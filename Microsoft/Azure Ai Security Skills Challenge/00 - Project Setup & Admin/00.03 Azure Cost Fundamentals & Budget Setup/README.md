## 💡 Lab Environment Cost-Saving Principles

**Essential Practices to Minimize Costs**:

- **Stop Resources When Not in Use**: Turn off VMs, pause services between learning sessions.
- **Use Minimal Resource Sizes**: Select smallest appropriate tiers for learning exercises.
- **Clean Up After Each Week**: Remove temporary resources that generate recurring charges.
- **Follow Module Guidance**: Each guide includes specific cost-optimization tips.
- **Monitor Weekly**: Review spending patterns and adjust resource usage accordingly.

> **🎯 Lab Focus**: These labs are designed for cost-effective learning. With proper resource management, most students spend $10-20/month total, well below the $150 safety budget. We provide cost-saving tips throughout each module to keep your actual costs well below this threshold.
