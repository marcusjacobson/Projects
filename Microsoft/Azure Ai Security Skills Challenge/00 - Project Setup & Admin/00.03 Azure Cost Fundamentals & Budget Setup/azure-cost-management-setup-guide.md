# Azure Cost Management & Budget Setup Guide

This comprehensive guide provides essential Azure cost concepts and step-by-step budget setup to protect your AI Security Skills Challenge learning environment from unexpected charges.

## üìã Overview

Understanding Azure billing and setting up cost protection is essential before starting your hands-on labs. This guide combines the fundamental concepts with practical setup steps to get you ready for cost-effective learning.

## üí∞ Azure Cost Fundamentals

### How Azure Pricing Works

**Pay-as-You-Go Model**:

- You only pay for resources you actually use.
- Billing is calculated hourly or per-transaction.
- Perfect for learning environments where usage varies.

**Key Cost Factors**:

- **Compute**: Virtual machines, app services, AI services (charged by usage time).
- **Storage**: Data storage, backups, file transfers (charged by gigabytes stored).
- **Networking**: Data moving between regions or to internet (charged by gigabytes transferred).

### Expected Learning Costs

| Week | Focus Area | Typical Cost Range | Key Cost Drivers |
|------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Week 1** | Defender for Cloud Foundation | $8-15 | VMs, Log Analytics, monitoring |
| **Week 2** | AI Foundation & Storage | $5-12 | Storage accounts, OpenAI service testing |
| **Week 3** | Logic Apps & Integration | $3-8 | Logic App executions, API calls |
| **Total Monthly** | **All Learning Activities** | **$15-30** | **With proper resource management** |

> **üí° Cost Reality**: The $150 budget provides significant safety margin. Most students spend $15-30/month total when following cost-saving practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Essential Cost-Saving Practices

### Before Each Lab Session

- Review current month's spending in Azure Cost Management.
- Clean up resources from previous weeks that are no longer needed.
- Verify budget alerts are working.

### During Lab Work

- **Stop VMs when not actively using them** (biggest cost saver).
- Use recommended resource sizes (typically the smallest available).
- Follow lab instructions carefully to avoid unnecessary resources.
- Disable services between learning sessions when possible.

### After Each Lab Session

- Review what resources were created.
- Keep only resources needed for next week's labs.
- Remove temporary test resources that generate ongoing charges.
