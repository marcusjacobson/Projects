- Define folder and prompt organization standards.
- Automate deployment and backup processes.
- Document the publishing workflow for consistency and reuse.

## üìÅ Deliverables

- Azure DevOps project board with defined sprints.
- GitHub repository initialized for skilling projects and documentation.
- Hugo-based GitHub Pages site structure scaffolded.
- Folder structure created for prompt library:
  - `Security/`
  - `Governance/`
  - `AI_Agents/`
- Prompt tagging convention and markdown template defined.
- Personal prompt library organized in Microsoft 365 Copilot Prompt Gallery.
- PowerShell script created to automate weekly prompt library backup.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Azure DevOps project board created and sprints defined  
- [x] GitHub repository initialized  
- [x] Hugo site structure scaffolded  
- [x] Prompt folder structure created  
- [x] Prompt tagging convention and markdown template defined
- [ ] ~~Prompt library organized in Microsoft 365 Copilot Prompt Gallery~~  
- [ ] ~~PowerShell backup script created and tested~~  

- After research and testing, I was looking to create a project specific prompt library in M365 teams, however the functionality only allows me to save it to my personal library at this time. Therefore the two related tasks are being omitted from the project.
