# Week 1 – AI-Infused Security Foundations

This folder focuses on establishing a foundational understanding of Microsoft Security Copilot and Defender for Cloud. The goal is to explore how AI enhances security operations and to begin building a prompt library that supports real-world security scenarios.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Review Microsoft Security Copilot documentation and use cases.
- Deploy Microsoft Defender for Cloud using both the Azure Portal and Infrastructure-as-Code (Bicep/Terraform).
- Enable AI-driven recommendations and alerts.
- Simulate a benign threat scenario to observe AI insights.
- Begin documenting prompt examples for Defender for Cloud and Copilot.
- Publish findings and prompt examples to the GitHub Pages site.

## 📁 Deliverables

- Defender for Cloud deployed via Azure Portal and Bicep/Terraform.
- AI-driven recommendations and alerts enabled and validated.
- Simulated threat scenario executed and insights captured.
- Initial prompt entries created for:
  - Threat detection.
  - Alert summarization.
  - AI-assisted remediation.
- Findings and prompt examples published to the Hugo site.
