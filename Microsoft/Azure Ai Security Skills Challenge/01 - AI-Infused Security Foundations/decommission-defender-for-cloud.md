   - Monitor for any unexpected ongoing charges

3. **Set Up Cost Alerts (Optional)**
   - Create budget alerts for the subscription
   - Set thresholds to catch any unexpected costs
   - Configure notifications for cost spikes

üì∏ **[View Cost Management Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)**

## üîç Verification Steps

After completing the decommissioning, verify complete cleanup:

### Verify Defender Deactivation

1. **Check Defender for Cloud Status**
   - Navigate to Defender for Cloud overview
   - Verify secure score shows "Not available" or very low score
   - Confirm no active recommendations
   - Check that no security alerts are being generated

2. **Verify VM Agent Removal**
   - RDP/SSH to your virtual machines
   - Check that monitoring agents are not running:

   **Windows VMs:**

   ```powershell
   Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*HealthService*" -or $_.Name -like "*MonitoringAgent*"}
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*MonitoringHost*" -or $_.Name -like "*HealthService*"}
   ```

   **Linux VMs:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status omsagent
   ps aux | grep omsagent
   ls /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/
   ```

### Test Security Features

1. **Verify No Security Monitoring**
   - Perform actions that would typically trigger alerts
   - Confirm no new alerts appear in Defender for Cloud
   - Check that compliance score is not updating

2. **Verify Data Collection Stopped**
   - Wait 2-4 hours after decommissioning
   - Check Log Analytics workspace for new data:

   ```kql
   SecurityEvent
   | where TimeGenerated > ago(2h)
   | count
   ```
   
   Should return 0 or very low counts

## üí° Best Practices for Decommissioning

### Documentation and Tracking

- Document the decommissioning process and timeline
- Keep records of what was removed for future reference
- Note any custom configurations for potential future deployments
- Maintain inventory of affected resources

### Gradual Decommissioning

- Consider disabling plans gradually rather than all at once
- Monitor for any business impact during the process
- Have a rollback plan if issues arise
- Test critical applications after agent removal

### Cost Monitoring

- Set up budget alerts to track cost reductions
- Monitor for 30 days to ensure all charges have stopped
- Review final bills to confirm expected savings
- Document cost impact for stakeholders

### Security Considerations

- Understand the security implications of removing protection
- Ensure alternative security measures are in place if needed
- Communicate changes to security teams and stakeholders
- Plan for redeployment timeline if this is temporary

---

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Agent Removal Problems

- **Issue**: VM extensions stuck in "Uninstalling" state
- **Solution**: Force restart the VM, then try uninstall again. If persistent, use Azure PowerShell/CLI to force removal

### Log Analytics Workspace Deletion Blocked

- **Issue**: Cannot delete workspace due to active connections
- **Solution**: Check for remaining connected resources (VMs, solutions, automation accounts). Remove connections first

### Persistent Defender Charges

- **Issue**: Costs continue after disabling plans
- **Solution**: Check for remaining enabled plans in child subscriptions or management groups. Review billing period timing

### Data Retention Issues

- **Issue**: Cannot immediately purge Log Analytics data
- **Solution**: Understand Azure's 14-day soft-delete policy. Use data purge APIs if immediate deletion is required

---

## üìö Post-Decommissioning Steps

After successful decommissioning:

1. **Document Lessons Learned**
   - Record any issues encountered during decommissioning
   - Note timing for each step to improve future processes
   - Document any custom configurations that should be preserved

2. **Prepare for Redeployment**
   - Clean up any remaining test resources
   - Plan for future Defender for Cloud deployments
   - Consider automation scripts for faster redeployment

3. **Review Security Posture**
   - Ensure alternative security measures are active
   - Update security documentation to reflect changes
   - Plan timeline for re-enabling protection if temporary

4. **Cost Optimization Review**
   - Verify expected cost savings are realized
   - Look for other optimization opportunities
   - Update budget forecasts and planning
