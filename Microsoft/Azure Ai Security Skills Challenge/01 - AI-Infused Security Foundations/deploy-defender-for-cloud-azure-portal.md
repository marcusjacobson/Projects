# Deploy Microsoft Defender for Cloud via Azure Portal (2025 Edition)

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying Microsoft Defender for Cloud in a fresh Azure environment using the Azure Portal, reflecting the latest architecture and features as of 2025.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An active Azure subscription with Owner or Contributor permissions
- Access to the Azure Portal
- Basic understanding of Azure resources and security concepts
- 2-3 virtual machines ready for monitoring (or we'll create them as part of this guide)

## üéØ Overview

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads. This deployment leverages the modern agentless architecture and native integrations available in 2025:

1. Enable Defender for Cloud on your subscription
2. Configure modern agent architecture (agentless + Defender for Endpoint)
3. Set up monitoring for virtual machines using current methods
4. Enable advanced threat protection features
5. Configure Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) only where specifically required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Architecture Changes (2025)

**Key Updates from Previous Versions:**
- **Log Analytics Agent (MMA) Deprecated**: MMA was retired in August 2024 and is no longer supported
- **Agentless Scanning**: Primary data collection method for most security assessments
- **Defender for Endpoint Integration**: Single agent approach for endpoint protection
- **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**: Only required for specific scenarios (Defender for SQL on machines and data ingestion benefits)

## üí° Best Practices and Tips (2025 Edition)

### Modern Architecture Benefits

- **Agentless scanning**: Eliminates agent sprawl and performance impact
- **Unified agent approach**: Single Defender for Endpoint agent for comprehensive protection
- **Enhanced coverage**: Multi-cloud and hybrid protection without complex agent management
- **Improved performance**: No impact on VM performance from security scanning

### Cost Optimization

- **Agentless benefits**: Reduced operational overhead and management costs
- **Selective AMA deployment**: Only deploy AMA where specifically required (SQL servers, data benefits)
- **Monitor scanning costs**: Use agentless scanning efficiently with built-in cost controls
- **Regional considerations**: Agentless scanning respects data residency requirements

### Security Hardening

- **Leverage agentless recommendations**: Act on comprehensive security findings without agent dependencies
- **Enable Defender for Endpoint integration**: Utilize single-agent approach for endpoint protection
- **Modern network security**: Implement micro-segmentation with NSGs and Azure Firewall
- **Azure Policy integration**: Use guest configuration for compliance without legacy agents

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Continuous agentless assessment**: Security posture evaluation without maintenance overhead
- **Integrated threat hunting**: Use Defender XDR for advanced hunting across cloud and endpoints
- **Automated remediation**: Leverage enhanced automation capabilities in 2025 features
- **Modern compliance reporting**: Use updated compliance frameworks and automated reporting

### Migration from Legacy Architecture

- **Disable MMA auto-provisioning**: Ensure deprecated Log Analytics Agent auto-provisioning is disabled
- **Remove legacy agents**: Use Microsoft's MMA removal utility for cleanup
- **Validate agentless coverage**: Confirm all security capabilities are covered by agentless scanning
- **Update monitoring queries**: Transition from MMA-based queries to agentless data sources

### Integration Considerations

- Plan integration with existing SIEM tools
- Configure API access for programmatic management
- Set up automation for common security tasks
- Document incident response procedures

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues (2025)

### Agentless Scanning Issues

- **Issue**: Agentless scanning not collecting data
- **Solution**: Check subscription permissions, verify Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled, ensure VMs are in supported regions

### Missing Security Recommendations

- **Issue**: No recommendations appearing after 30+ minutes
- **Solution**: Verify agentless scanning is enabled, check that VMs are properly registered in Azure, confirm subscription has appropriate permissions

### Defender for Endpoint Integration Problems

- **Issue**: Endpoint protection not showing as enabled
- **Solution**: Verify Defender for Endpoint integration is enabled in Environment Settings, check VM compliance with Defender for Endpoint requirements

### Legacy Agent Conflicts

- **Issue**: Old MMA agents still installed causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Use Microsoft's MMA removal utility, disable legacy auto-provisioning, ensure clean migration to agentless architecture

### High Scanning Costs

- **Issue**: Unexpected charges for agentless scanning
- **Solution**: Review scanning frequency settings, optimize regional scanning policies, monitor usage through Azure Cost Management

### Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) Issues

- **Issue**: AMA not collecting data for SQL servers
- **Solution**: Verify AMA auto-provisioning is enabled for Defender for SQL, check SQL server registration with Azure Arc if on-premises
