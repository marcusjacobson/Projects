## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Failures

##### Permission Issues

```powershell
# Verify required permissions
az role assignment list --assignee $(az account show --query user.name --output tsv) --scope "/subscriptions/$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"
```

**Solution**: Ensure you have Owner, Contributor, or Security Admin roles.

#### JIT Configuration Issues

##### JIT Policy Not Found in Validation

**Issue**: JIT policy created successfully but validation shows **No JIT policies found**

**Root Cause**: Location formatting inconsistencies between creation and validation APIs

**Solution**: Scripts automatically handle location conversion (**West US** → **westus**) using subscription-level endpoints

##### JIT Policy Propagation Delay

**Issue**: JIT policy creation succeeds but immediate validation fails

**Root Cause**: Azure security policies may take 10-30 seconds to propagate across regions

**Solution**: Scripts include automatic wait periods and retry logic for policy validation

##### Verification Commands

```powershell
# Manual verification of JIT policies
$subscriptionId = az account show --query "id" --output tsv
$location = "westus"  # Replace with your region (lowercase, no spaces)

# Check JIT policies at subscription level
az rest --method GET --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/$location/jitNetworkAccessPolicies?api-version=2020-01-01" --query "value[].{Name:name, VMs:properties.virtualMachines[].id}" --output table
```

**Solution**: Ensure you have Owner, Contributor, or Security Admin roles.

##### Resource Naming Conflicts

**Error**: `The domain name label is invalid or reserved`

**Solution**: Edit the `environmentName` or `resourceToken` value in `main.parameters.json` to use a more unique identifier (e.g., add your initials or date).

##### Quota Limitations

```powershell
# Check VM quota in your region
az vm list-usage --location "East US" --output table
```

**Solution**: Choose a different region or request quota increase.

#### Configuration Issues

##### No VM Extensions Installed (Expected Behavior)

**Issue**: Validation shows "Extensions: Agentless scanning enabled (Plan 2)" or no VM extensions installed

**Root Cause**: This is **expected and correct** behavior for Defender for Servers Plan 2

**Explanation**:

- **Plan 2 uses agentless scanning** - no VM extensions required for security monitoring
- **JIT VM Access** works at the network level, independent of VM extensions
- **Vulnerability assessment** and **malware detection** work without agents
- **Extensions are optional** - only needed for specific scenarios (custom monitoring, etc.)

**Verification**: This is working correctly - no action needed.

##### No Security Alerts Appearing

1. Verify Defender plans are in Standard tier (not Free).
2. Wait 24-48 hours for initial data collection.
3. Generate sample alerts via Azure Portal.

##### Agentless Scanning Not Active

1. Confirm Defender for Servers Plan 2 is enabled.
2. Check VM status in Asset Inventory.
3. Allow 24-48 hours for initial scan completion.
