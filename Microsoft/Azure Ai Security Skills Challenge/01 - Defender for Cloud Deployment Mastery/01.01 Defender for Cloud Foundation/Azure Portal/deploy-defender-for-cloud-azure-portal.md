## ✅ Step 2 Network Infrastructure Verification

The portal guide has been updated to match our proven IaC deployment structure:

### **Network Infrastructure Alignment Confirmed:**

✅ **Virtual Network Creation**:

- Portal: `vnet-aisec-defender-portal` with `10.0.0.0/16`
- IaC: `vnet-${environmentName}-${resourceToken}` with `10.0.0.0/16`

✅ **Subnet Configuration**:

- Portal: `subnet-vms` with `10.0.1.0/24`
- IaC: `subnet-default` with `10.0.1.0/24`

✅ **Network Security Group**:

- Portal: `nsg-aisec-vms` with RDP/SSH rules.
- IaC: `nsg-${environmentName}-${resourceToken}` with identical rules.

✅ **VM Network Association**:

- Portal: VMs explicitly configured to use the created VNET and subnet.
- IaC: NICs reference `virtualNetwork.properties.subnets[0].id`.

### **Deployment Validation Steps:**

The portal guide now ensures that when VMs are created:

1. **Networking Tab Configuration** explicitly selects the created VNET and subnet.
2. **NIC Network Security Group** uses the Advanced option to reference the created NSG.
3. **Public IP Configuration** follows the same pattern as IaC (Static Standard SKU).
