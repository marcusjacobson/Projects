# Week 1 to Week 2 Bridge: Unified Security Operations Validation

## **ðŸŽ¯ Purpose**

This guide provides the essential setup required to bridge your Week 1 Defender for Cloud deployment to Week 2 modern unified security operations. After completing Week 1 infrastructure deployment, these steps prepare your environment for advanced AI security capabilities.

## **ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites**

- Completed Week 1 Defender for Cloud deployment (any method: Portal, Modular IaC, or Complete Automation).
- Microsoft Sentinel workspace deployed and operational.
- Access to Microsoft Defender Portal (security.microsoft.com).

## **ðŸš€ Essential Bridge Steps**

### **Step 1: Validate Infrastructure Readiness**

Confirm your Week 1 deployment is ready for modern unified operations:

```powershell
cd ".\scripts"
.\Test-UnifiedSecurityReadiness.ps1 -UseParametersFile -DetailedReport
```

**Expected Result:** 5/5 readiness score confirming platform is ready for Week 2 advanced feature configuration.

> **Important:** The 5/5 score indicates your platform has the foundation needed for Week 2 configurations, not that advanced features are already configured. Steps 3-5 validate "readiness for configuration" rather than "actual configuration status."

### **Step 2: Access Microsoft Defender Portal**

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in with your Azure account
3. Verify you can access the unified security operations dashboard
4. Confirm your Sentinel workspace appears in the workspace selector

### **Step 3: Verify Cross-Product Integration**

1. In Defender Portal, navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Microsoft Sentinel**
2. Confirm your Sentinel workspace is listed and connected
3. Verify status shows as "Connected" for unified operations
4. Test navigation between Defender XDR and Sentinel interfaces

## **âœ… Bridge Completion Checklist**

- [ ] Infrastructure validation shows 5/5 readiness score
- [ ] Microsoft Defender Portal accessible and operational
- [ ] Sentinel workspace connected to unified operations platform
- [ ] Cross-product navigation working between platforms

> **Clarification:** Steps 3-5 of the validation script check "readiness for Week 2 configuration" not "actual configuration status". The 5/5 score confirms your platform foundation is ready for advanced feature enablement in Week 2.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Week 2 Preparation Complete**

Once all bridge steps are completed successfully, your environment is ready for Week 2 advanced AI security operations.

**What's Ready:**

- âœ… Infrastructure foundation for unified security operations
- âœ… Platform connectivity and access verified
- âœ… Cross-product integration capabilities confirmed

**What's Covered in Week 2:**

- ðŸ”— Defender XDR integration configuration
- ðŸ§  Unified behavioral analytics setup  
- ðŸŽ¯ Modern detection rules deployment
- ðŸ“Š Incident management workflow automation
- ðŸ¤– Advanced AI-powered threat correlation

> **Note:** Advanced security configurations and feature enablement are covered in Week 2 guides. The bridge validation confirms your environment is *ready* for these configurations, but they are not required to complete Week 1 or start Week 2.
