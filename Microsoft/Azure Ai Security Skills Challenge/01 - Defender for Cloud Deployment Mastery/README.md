# Week 1 – Defender for Cloud Deployment Mastery

This week focuses on mastering Microsoft Defender for Cloud deployment through three distinct approaches. The goal is to build a solid security infrastructure foundation that will support AI integration in subsequent weeks.

## 🌍 Regional Deployment Requirement

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: All deployments use **East US** region for complete AI security coverage and Week 2 compliance.

**Why East US is Critical:**

- **UEBA Availability**: User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) required for Week 2 has limited regional availability.
- **Week 2 Preparation**: Ensures all unified security operations features are available for hands-on learning.
- **Curriculum Compliance**: Week 2 explicitly requires modern security operations platform integration and validation.
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoids potential need for cross-region deployments or resource migration.

The `main.parameters.json` file is configured for East US deployment. **Do not change the region** to ensure Week 2 compatibility.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master Azure Portal deployment for comprehensive learning and understanding.
- Implement Modular Infrastructure-as-Code approach for controlled automation.
- Execute Complete Automation deployment for enterprise-ready scenarios.
- Configure baseline security policies and monitoring.
- Validate deployment effectiveness through testing scenarios.
- Document deployment best practices and lessons learned.
- Validate security baselines and prepare for AI integration in East US region.

## 📁 Deliverables

- Defender for Cloud deployed via Azure Portal (comprehensive learning path).
- Defender for Cloud deployed via Modular Infrastructure-as-Code (PowerShell + Bicep).
- Defender for Cloud deployed via Complete Automation (enterprise-ready).
- Deployment comparison guide with practical recommendations.
- Week 2 bridge validation confirming readiness for modern unified security operations.
