## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Deployment Failures:**

- **Permission Issues**: Verify Owner/Contributor/Security Admin roles at subscription level
- **Resource Naming Conflicts**: Use unique `-EnvironmentName` parameter (avoid "prod", "test", "demo")
- **Quota Limitations**: Check regional VM quotas and request increases if needed
- **Bicep Template Errors**: Run `az bicep build` to validate syntax before deployment
- **Parameter File Issues**: Ensure main.parameters.json exists and has proper JSON formatting

**Authentication and Access:**

- **Azure CLI Authentication**: Run `az login` and verify with `az account show`
- **Multiple Subscriptions**: Use `az account set --subscription "subscription-name"` to select correct subscription
- **PowerShell Execution Policy**: Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

**Configuration Issues:**

- **Missing Security Alerts**: Wait 24-48 hours for initial data collection after plan enablement
- **Agentless Scanning Not Active**: Confirm Defender for Servers Plan 2 enabled (not Plan 1)
- **JIT Policies Not Working**: Verify network security group configurations and VM running state
- **Sentinel Data Connectors**: Portal configuration required after script enablement
- **Cost Formatting Issues**: PowerShell string escaping - use backtick before dollar signs

**Script-Specific Issues:**

- **Parameter Loading**: Scripts automatically load from main.parameters.json, no `-UseParametersFile` flag needed
- **JSON ConvertFrom-Json Errors**: Often caused by API timeouts - retry the operation
- **REST API Version Conflicts**: Update to latest API versions (2023-04-01-preview for Sentinel)
- **Table vs JSON Output**: Use `--output table` for long-running operations to avoid JSON parsing issues

**Validation Script Issues:**

- **Final Validation Jumping Steps**: All 10 steps now included with portal guidance for 7-9
- **Architecture Verification**: Run Test-DeploymentValidation.ps1 for detailed infrastructure validation
- **Cost Display Problems**: Fixed with proper PowerShell string escaping in validation scripts

**Performance and Optimization:**

- **VM Costs Too High**: Configure auto-shutdown for 67% cost reduction (~$30/month savings)
- **Slow Deployment**: VM deployment takes 8-12 minutes - this is normal for extension installation
- **Security Extension Failures**: Retry deployment - extensions sometimes need multiple attempts
