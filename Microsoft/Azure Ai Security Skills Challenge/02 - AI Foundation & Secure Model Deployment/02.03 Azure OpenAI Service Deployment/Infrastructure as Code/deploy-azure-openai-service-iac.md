### Managed Identity Configuration

#### System-Assigned Managed Identity (Default)

The deployment automatically configures system-assigned managed identity:

- **Automatic Configuration**: Enabled during Azure OpenAI service creation.
- **Security Benefits**: No credential management required.
- **Access Scope**: Scoped to the specific OpenAI resource.
- **Integration Ready**: Configured for storage foundation access.

#### User-Assigned Managed Identity (Optional)

For advanced scenarios requiring user-assigned managed identity, refer to the comprehensive user-assigned identity configuration guide:

**üìñ Reference Guide**: [Configure User-Assigned Managed Identity for Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity)

**Key Considerations**:

- **Advanced Configuration**: Requires additional Bicep template modifications.
- **Cross-Resource Access**: Useful for shared identity across multiple resources.
- **Custom Permissions**: Enables granular permission control.
- **Enterprise Scenarios**: Recommended for production environments with complex identity requirements.

### Automated Validation Checks

The deployment script performs comprehensive validation:

| Validation Category | Check Description | Success Criteria |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Resource Deployment** | Verify OpenAI service creation | Resource status: Succeeded |
| **Model Availability** | Confirm model deployments | Models: Running status |
| **Identity Configuration** | Validate managed identity | System identity: Enabled |
| **Monitoring Setup** | Verify diagnostic settings | Logs flowing to LAW |
| **Security Testing** | Test model access permissions | API calls successful |
| **Cost Configuration** | Verify pricing tier settings | Standard S0 confirmed |

#### Manual Verification Steps (Optional)

1. **Azure Portal Verification**:
   - Navigate to resource group `rg-aisec-ai`.
   - Confirm Azure OpenAI service is listed and running.
   - Verify model deployments in Azure AI Foundry.

2. **Cost Monitoring Verification**:
   - Check Cost Management + Billing for OpenAI resources.
   - Confirm no unexpected charges beyond estimated amounts.

3. **Security Configuration Verification**:
   - Verify managed identity is enabled in the Identity section.
   - Confirm diagnostic settings are configured.

### Deployment Testing

The deployment script includes basic endpoint validation and connectivity testing. However, **comprehensive prompt testing should be performed using Azure AI Foundry** for the most reliable and comprehensive results.

#### PowerShell Script Testing (Basic Validation)

The deployment script can perform basic connectivity testing:

```powershell
# Run deployment with basic security testing
.\Deploy-OpenAIService.ps1 -UseParametersFile -RunSecurityTests

# Or use the dedicated testing script
.\Test-OpenAIEndpoints.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -TestSecurityPrompts
```

**PowerShell Testing Results:**

- ‚úÖ Endpoint connectivity validation
- ‚úÖ Model deployment verification  
- ‚úÖ API key accessibility confirmation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Actual prompt testing requires manual verification

### Comprehensive Prompt Testing in Azure AI Foundry

**For complete prompt testing and validation, use Azure AI Foundry:**

1. **Access Azure AI Foundry**:
   - Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com)
   - Sign in with your Azure account
   - Select your OpenAI resource: `openai-aisec-001`

2. **Test Security-Focused Prompts**:

#### Test 1: Threat Analysis Prompt

```text
Prompt: "Analyze this log entry for potential security threats: 'User admin logged in from IP 192.168.1.100 at 03:47 AM, accessed sensitive files, then logged out after 2 minutes.'"

Expected Response Type: Structured threat analysis with risk assessment and recommendations.
```

#### Test 2: Incident Response Prompt

```text
Prompt: "Create a basic incident response checklist for a suspected data breach scenario."

Expected Response Type: Organized checklist with immediate actions and escalation procedures.
```

#### Test 3: Log Analytics Integration Test

```text
Prompt: "Generate a KQL query to find failed login attempts in the last 24 hours."

Expected Response Type: Valid KQL query syntax for Azure Log Analytics.
```
