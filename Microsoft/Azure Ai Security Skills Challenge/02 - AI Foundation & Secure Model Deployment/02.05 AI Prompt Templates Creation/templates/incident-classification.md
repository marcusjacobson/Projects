#### **Testing Process Overview**

**INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MESSAGE:**

```text
You are an expert cybersecurity analyst specializing in rapid incident triage and severity assessment with advanced threat classification capabilities. Analyze security alerts for accurate severity determination, confidence scoring, and false positive detection. Your assessments must be consistent, evidence-based, and optimized for automated workflow routing. Provide structured classifications focusing on business impact, response urgency, and resource allocation requirements. Include confidence scoring and false positive analysis to support both automated processing and human review decisions within 300 tokens maximum.
```

**USER MESSAGE FORMAT:**

## ðŸ”— Logic Apps Integration

### **HTTP Action Configuration for Incident Classification**

Once your AI Foundry testing confirms optimal classification accuracy, integrate with Logic Apps using this configuration:

**Logic Apps HTTP Action Setup:**

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "uri": "@parameters('azure-openai-endpoint')",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "api-key": "@parameters('azure-openai-api-key')"
  },
  "body": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an expert cybersecurity analyst specializing in rapid incident triage and severity assessment with advanced threat classification capabilities.

## ðŸ’¬ Comment Parsing Configuration

### **Expected AI Response Structure**

Your incident classification will generate structured comments that separate severity assessment, business impact, response priority, and false positive analysis:

**Sample Expected Response:**

```text
**INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION:**
Severity: HIGH | Confidence: 0.85
Classification: True Positive - Credential compromise with active exploitation evidence

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
Immediate Risk: Domain administrator access enables full network compromise potential
Data Security: Unauthorized access to all organizational systems and sensitive data repositories
Compliance: SOX/ISO 27001 violations due to unauthorized privileged account access

**RESPONSE PRIORITY:**
Urgency: IMMEDIATE (within 15 minutes)
Human Review: YES - Critical severity requires senior analyst validation and coordination
Escalation: Executive notification required for domain-level security compromise
Timeline: Containment actions must begin within 30 minutes to prevent lateral movement

**FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS:**
Likelihood: 15% - Multiple attack indicators significantly reduce false positive probability
Evidence: TOR network usage, off-hours timing, PowerShell obfuscation techniques
Indicators: Legitimate administrative activity would not utilize anonymization networks or obfuscation

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. ISOLATE affected domain controller immediately to prevent lateral movement
2. RESET all privileged account passwords and revoke active sessions
3. ACTIVATE incident response team for comprehensive threat assessment
4. MONITOR for additional compromise indicators across enterprise infrastructure
```

### **Comment Integration in Defender XDR**

The incident classification appears as structured comments in Microsoft Defender XDR incidents, providing SOC teams with:

- **Automated Severity Assessment**: Consistent, evidence-based threat level determination.
- **Confidence-Based Routing**: High-confidence classifications enable automated processing.
- **False Positive Detection**: Intelligent filtering reducing analyst workload by 60-70%.
- **Response Prioritization**: Clear urgency levels supporting resource allocation decisions.

## ðŸ§ª Advanced Testing Scenarios & Validation

### Core Testing Scenarios

#### 1. Mass Alert Processing Validation

**Test Scenario**: Batch processing of 20+ similar alerts to validate classification consistency

**Sample Test Data**:

```text
Batch Test Set:
Alert 1: Failed RDP login attempt from 192.168.1.100 to SERVER-01 (user: admin)
Alert 2: Failed RDP login attempt from 192.168.1.100 to SERVER-02 (user: admin)
Alert 3: Failed RDP login attempt from 192.168.1.100 to SERVER-03 (user: admin)
[Continue with variations: different IPs, users, times, success/failure patterns]
```

**Expected Consistency Validation**:

- **Similar Patterns**: 95%+ classification agreement across similar alerts.
- **Severity Progression**: Escalating severity with increasing indicators.
- **False Positive Detection**: Consistent identification of benign patterns.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Similar confidence levels for similar evidence quality.

#### 2. Mixed Severity Event Testing

**Test Scenario**: Classification accuracy across different threat levels

**Critical Severity Test**:

```text
Domain administrator account "DA-Admin" successfully authenticated from TOR exit node 185.220.101.45 at 02:30 UTC, followed by immediate privilege escalation attempts and lateral movement to domain controllers. Multiple systems now showing signs of compromise.
```

**Expected Classification Output**:

```text
**INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION:**
Severity: CRITICAL | Confidence: 0.95
Classification: True Positive - Domain compromise in progress

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
Immediate Risk: Complete domain compromise potential
Data Security: Full organizational data exposure risk
Compliance: Multiple framework violations (SOX, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS)

**RESPONSE PRIORITY:**
Urgency: IMMEDIATE (within 5 minutes)
Human Review: NO - Critical severity requires immediate automated response
Escalation: C-level executive notification required
Timeline: Containment actions must begin immediately

**FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS:**
Likelihood: 5% - Multiple high-confidence indicators present
Evidence: TOR usage, privilege escalation, lateral movement patterns
Indicators: No legitimate business scenario matches this activity pattern
```

#### 3. False Positive Detection Validation

**Test Scenario**: Ability to identify benign activities correctly

**Legitimate Business Activity**:

```text
Multiple failed login attempts detected for service account "svc-backup" accessing file server FS-CORP-01. Failed attempts: 15 over 30 minutes, followed by successful authentication. Scheduled backup job "Daily-FS-Backup" started immediately after successful authentication.
```

**Expected Classification Output**:

```text
**INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION:**
Severity: INFORMATIONAL | Confidence: 0.85
Classification: Benign Positive - Legitimate service account activity

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
Immediate Risk: No operational impact
Data Security: No security implications
Compliance: Standard service account behavior

**RESPONSE PRIORITY:**
Urgency: LOW (routine monitoring)
Human Review: NO - Clear benign pattern with high confidence
Escalation: None required
Timeline: Log for trend analysis, no immediate action

**FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS:**
Likelihood: 85% - Pattern consistent with scheduled service activity
Evidence: Service account name, scheduled timing, successful job execution
Indicators: Failed attempts followed by job execution matches normal service behavior
```

#### 4. Edge Case Handling

**Test Scenario**: Ambiguous incidents requiring human judgment

**Ambiguous Activity**:

```text
User account "jsmith@company.com" accessed unusual files in HR directory "\\fs-hr-01\confidential\salary-data\" outside normal business hours (22:30 local time). User has legitimate HR access but unusual timing and specific file access pattern. No previous after-hours access history.
```

**Expected Classification Output**:

```text
**INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION:**
Severity: MEDIUM | Confidence: 0.60
Classification: Unknown - Requires human validation

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
Immediate Risk: Potential unauthorized access to sensitive data
Data Security: HR confidential data exposure risk
Compliance: Privacy regulation considerations (GDPR, CCPA)

**RESPONSE PRIORITY:**
Urgency: HIGH (within 2 hours)
Human Review: YES - Low confidence and sensitive data access
Escalation: HR and Security team notification
Timeline: Investigation must begin within 1 hour

**FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS:**
Likelihood: 50% - Legitimate access but unusual circumstances
Evidence: Valid user credentials, appropriate file permissions
Indicators: Unusual timing and specific file pattern require investigation
```
