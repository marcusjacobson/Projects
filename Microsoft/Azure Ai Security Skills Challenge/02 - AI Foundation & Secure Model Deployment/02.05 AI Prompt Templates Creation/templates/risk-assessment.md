## Logic Apps Integration Quick Reference

This section provides the key data points needed to modify your Logic App being built in Week 3 to add risk assessment capabilities. The detailed implementation steps will be covered in future labs.

### AI Foundry System Message Update

**First, update your AI Foundry deployment** with the risk assessment system message from the testing section above. This ensures your model is optimized for quantitative risk analysis before Logic Apps integration.

1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry** â†’ Your deployment â†’ **Chat** interface
2. **Update System Message** with the comprehensive risk assessment prompt from the testing section
3. **Test the updated configuration** using the provided test scenarios
4. **Validate risk scoring accuracy and business impact precision** before proceeding to Logic Apps integration

### Logic App Configuration

Update the **Analyze Incident with AI** action in the logic app to use the following settings:

#### Message Configuration - Risk Assessment

Replace your existing **messages** array with this JSON configuration for easy copy-paste:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a senior risk management analyst specializing in cybersecurity risk assessment and business impact quantification with expertise in enterprise risk frameworks. Focus on quantitative risk analysis using industry-standard frameworks, business impact evaluation across financial/operational/strategic dimensions, control effectiveness assessment with investment prioritization, and strategic implications for enterprise risk management. Create actionable risk assessments that support data-driven decision-making for cybersecurity investments."
  },
  {
    "role": "user", 
    "content": "Create comprehensive risk assessment for this Defender XDR incident: Title: [INCIDENT_TITLE], Description: [INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION], Severity: [INCIDENT_SEVERITY]. OUTPUT 5 SECTIONS: **RISK PROFILE:** Overall risk score with confidence intervals and risk categorization **BUSINESS IMPACT:** Financial impact ranges and operational disruption assessment **CONTROL ASSESSMENT:** Current security control effectiveness and investment priorities **MITIGATION ANALYSIS:** Risk reduction strategies with cost-benefit analysis and ROI **STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:** Long-term business effects and competitive positioning impact.

```

### Comment Parsing Configuration

**Update your existing comment extraction actions** with this structured approach for risk assessment:

#### Update Extract AI Analysis Sections (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Extract AI Analysis Sections` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this risk assessment configuration:

```json
{
  "riskProfile": "@{first(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**BUSINESS IMPACT:**'))}",
  "businessImpact": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**BUSINESS IMPACT:**')), '**CONTROL ASSESSMENT:**'))}",
  "controlAssessment": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**CONTROL ASSESSMENT:**')), '**MITIGATION ANALYSIS:**'))}",
  "mitigationAnalysis": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**MITIGATION ANALYSIS:**')), '**STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:**'))}",
  "strategicImplications": "@{last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:**'))}"
}
```

#### Update Create Comments Array (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Create Comments Array` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this risk assessment configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "prefix": "[Risk - Profile]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['riskProfile']}",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Risk - Business Impact]", 
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['businessImpact']}",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Risk - Control Assessment]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['controlAssessment']}",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Risk - Mitigation Analysis]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['mitigationAnalysis']}",
    "order": 4
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Risk - Strategic Impact]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['strategicImplications']}",
    "order": 5
  }
]
```

### Cost Impact

| Metric | Default Setup | Risk Assessment Template | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Cost per Incident** | ~$0.00018 | ~$0.00041 | **+$0.00023** (2.3x) |
| **Token Usage** | 180-200 tokens | 420-450 tokens | **+240 tokens** |
| **Execution Time** | 30-45 seconds | 120-180 seconds | **+90-135 seconds** |
| **Comments Generated** | 4 analysis comments | 5 risk assessments | **+1 comment** |

**Cost Justification**: The 2.3x cost increase provides comprehensive risk quantification and strategic business impact analysis, potentially supporting risk-informed decisions worth millions in avoided losses and optimized security investments.
