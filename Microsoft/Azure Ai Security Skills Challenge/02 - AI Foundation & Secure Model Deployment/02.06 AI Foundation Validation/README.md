# AI Foundation Validation

This module provides comprehensive validation and testing for the complete AI Foundation & Secure Model Deployment infrastructure. Execute systematic testing to ensure all components are properly deployed, configured, and ready for Week 3 automated security operations integration.

## üìã Module Overview

### Learning Objectives

- Execute comprehensive end-to-end validation of AI foundation infrastructure components.
- Validate Azure OpenAI service functionality, model performance, and cost optimization effectiveness.
- Test AI prompt template effectiveness with baseline performance establishment and quality metrics.
- Verify security controls, compliance alignment, and integration readiness for automation workflows.
- Establish performance baselines and monitoring for ongoing AI operation optimization.

### Module Purpose

Systematic validation ensures your AI foundation infrastructure is production-ready for automated security operations. This comprehensive testing covers infrastructure deployment, AI model performance, security compliance, and integration readiness for Week 3 progression.
