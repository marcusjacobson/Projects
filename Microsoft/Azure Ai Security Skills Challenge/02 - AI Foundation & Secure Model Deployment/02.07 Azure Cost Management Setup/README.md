- Complete optimization validation and testing procedures

## 💡 Week 2 Cost Optimization Tips

### Expected Week 2 Cost Range

**Typical Spending** (Reference from Week 00):

```json
{
  "week2_cost_expectations": {
    "azure_openai_service": "$15-25 (GPT-4o-mini with 100 TPM)",
    "storage_account": "$1-3 (Standard_LRS configuration)",
    "application_insights": "$2-5 (monitoring and telemetry)",
    "total_expected_range": "$18-33 per month"
  }
}
```

### Common Optimization Opportunities
