### Token Usage Analysis

**Actual Token Consumption Review**:

Based on your deployed GPT-4o-mini model from module 02.04:

```powershell
# Retrieve actual token usage metrics
az cognitiveservices account list-usage \
  --name "oai-aisec-ai" \
  --resource-group "rg-aisec-ai" \
  --query "value[?name.value=='TokenTransaction']" \
  --output table

# Alternative: Monitor API usage through Azure Monitor
az monitor metrics list \
  --resource "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/rg-aisec-ai/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/oai-aisec-ai" \
  --metric "TokenTransaction" \
  --interval PT1H \
  --start-time $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-01T00:00:00Z")
```

**Token Cost Breakdown Analysis**:

```json
{
  "week2_token_analysis": {
    "learning_activities": {
      "module_02_04_testing": "~50K tokens",
      "module_02_05_templates": "~75K tokens", 
      "module_02_06_validation": "~100K tokens"
    },
    "total_estimated_tokens": "~225K tokens",
    "cost_calculation": {
      "input_tokens": "150K √ó $0.15/1M = $0.023",
      "output_tokens": "75K √ó $0.60/1M = $0.045",
      "total_token_cost": "~$0.07 for learning activities",
      "capacity_cost": "$15-25/month for 100 TPM reservation"
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Pattern Optimization Opportunities

**Analyze Your Actual Usage Patterns**:

- **Peak Usage Times**: When do you use AI services most frequently during Week 2?
- **Token Efficiency**: What's your cost per security analysis from testing activities?
- **Capacity Utilization**: Is your 100 TPM capacity appropriate for actual usage patterns?
- **Response Quality vs Cost**: How well do 450-token limits balance analysis quality with cost?

**Cost Per Analysis Calculation**:

```powershell
# Calculate average cost per security analysis
$totalTokenCost = 0.07  # From your actual usage analysis
$analysesPerformed = 25  # Count from your Week 2 testing
$costPerAnalysis = $totalTokenCost / $analysesPerformed

Write-Output "Average cost per security analysis: $($costPerAnalysis.ToString('C4'))"
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Storage Account Cost Analysis

### Storage Utilization Review

**Analyze Your Storage Costs** from module 02.02 deployment:

```powershell
# Storage account usage and cost analysis
az storage account show-usage \
  --account-name "staisecai" \
  --resource-group "rg-aisec-ai"

# Detailed storage metrics
az monitor metrics list \
  --resource "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/rg-aisec-ai/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/staisecai" \
  --metric "UsedCapacity" \
  --interval P1D \
  --start-time $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-01T00:00:00Z")
```
