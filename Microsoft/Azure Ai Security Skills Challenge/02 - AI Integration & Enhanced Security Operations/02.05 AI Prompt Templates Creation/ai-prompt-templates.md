## üîß Core Security Analysis Templates

### Template Categories

The template library provides four main categories of specialized analysis:

1. **[Threat Analysis Templates](#threat-analysis-templates)** - Technical threat hunting and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
2. **[Business Communication Templates](#business-communication-templates)** - Executive reporting and stakeholder communication.
3. **[Operational Response Templates](#operational-response-templates)** - Incident response and remediation guidance.
4. **[Compliance & Governance Templates](#compliance--governance-templates)** - Regulatory analysis and risk assessment.

### Template Usage in AI Foundry

Each template is designed for testing and refinement in your AI Foundry playground before automation integration:

```text
Testing Approach in AI Foundry:
1. Keep your existing system message from 02.04 unchanged
2. Copy template content into the user message area
3. Add sample incident data for realistic testing
4. Evaluate response quality and adjust template as needed
5. Note token usage and cost efficiency
```

**AI Foundry Playground Configuration:**

- **System Message**: Your established cybersecurity analyst instructions from 02.04
- **User Message**: `[Template content] + [Sample incident data]`
- **Parameters**: Temperature 0.2, Max tokens 450 (as configured in 02.04)
