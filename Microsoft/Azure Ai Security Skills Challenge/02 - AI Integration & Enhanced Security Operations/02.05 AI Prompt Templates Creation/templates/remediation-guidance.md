## Template Enhancement Context

Your AI Foundry model testing validated technical remediation capabilities. Logic Apps integration adds **automated remediation planning** for:

- System-specific recovery procedures from Defender XDR incidents.
- Technical validation steps and testing requirements.
- Recovery timeline estimation with resource planning.
- Security hardening recommendations tailored to incident types.

## Logic Apps Integration Quick Reference

This section provides the key data points needed to modify your Logic App being built in **02.06** to add remediation guidance capabilities. The detailed implementation steps will be covered in lab **02.07**.

### AI Foundry System Message Update

**First, update your AI Foundry deployment** with the remediation guidance system message from the testing section above. This ensures your model is optimized for technical remediation planning before Logic Apps integration.

1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry** â†’ Your deployment â†’ **Chat** interface
2. **Update System Message** with the comprehensive remediation guidance prompt from the testing section
3. **Test the updated configuration** using the provided test scenarios
4. **Validate technical accuracy and completeness** before proceeding to Logic Apps integration

### Logic App Configuration

Update the **Analyze Incident with AI** action in the logic app to use the following settings:

#### Message Configuration - Remediation Guidance

Replace your existing **messages** array with this JSON configuration for easy copy-paste:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a senior security engineer specializing in incident response and technical remediation with expertise in enterprise infrastructure recovery. Focus on immediate containment procedures, step-by-step technical recovery with validation checkpoints, system-specific hardening recommendations, recovery timeline estimation with resource requirements, and post-remediation monitoring. Create actionable technical remediation plans that ensure thorough incident recovery while implementing preventive measures to strengthen security posture."
  },
  {
    "role": "user", 
    "content": "Create comprehensive technical remediation plan for this Defender XDR incident: Title: [INCIDENT_TITLE], Description: [INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION], Severity: [INCIDENT_SEVERITY]. OUTPUT 5 SECTIONS: **IMMEDIATE CONTAINMENT:** Critical isolation procedures and evidence preservation steps **TECHNICAL RECOVERY:** Step-by-step remediation with validation checkpoints **SYSTEM HARDENING:** Security improvements and configuration changes **RECOVERY VALIDATION:** Testing procedures and success criteria **TIMELINE & RESOURCES:** Recovery phases with expertise and resource requirements. REQUIREMENTS: Technically accurate procedures, evidence preservation, realistic timelines, TOKEN LIMIT: 400 tokens maximum."
  }
]
```

### Expected AI Response Structure

The AI will return structured output in this format:

```text
**IMMEDIATE CONTAINMENT:** [Containment and preservation content]

**TECHNICAL RECOVERY:** [Recovery procedures content]

**SYSTEM HARDENING:** [Hardening recommendations content]

**RECOVERY VALIDATION:** [Validation procedures content]

**TIMELINE & RESOURCES:** [Timeline and resource content]
```

### Comment Parsing Configuration

**Update your existing comment extraction actions** with this structured approach for remediation guidance:

#### Update Extract AI Analysis Sections (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Extract AI Analysis Sections` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this remediation guidance configuration:

```json
{
  "immediateContainment": "@{first(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**TECHNICAL RECOVERY:**'))}",
  "technicalRecovery": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**TECHNICAL RECOVERY:**')), '**SYSTEM HARDENING:**'))}",
  "systemHardening": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**SYSTEM HARDENING:**')), '**RECOVERY VALIDATION:**'))}",
  "recoveryValidation": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**RECOVERY VALIDATION:**')), '**TIMELINE & RESOURCES:**'))}",
  "timelineResources": "@{last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**TIMELINE & RESOURCES:**'))}"
}
```

#### Update Create Comments Array (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Create Comments Array` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this remediation guidance configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "prefix": "[Remediation - Containment]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['immediateContainment']}",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Remediation - Recovery]", 
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['technicalRecovery']}",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Remediation - Hardening]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['systemHardening']}",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Remediation - Validation]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['recoveryValidation']}",
    "order": 4
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Remediation - Timeline]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['timelineResources']}",
    "order": 5
  }
]
```

### Cost Impact

| Metric | Default Setup | Remediation Template | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Cost per Incident** | ~$0.00018 | ~$0.00036 | **+$0.00018** (2x) |
| **Token Usage** | 180-200 tokens | 380-400 tokens | **+200 tokens** |
| **Execution Time** | 30-45 seconds | 90-150 seconds | **+60-105 seconds** |
| **Comments Generated** | 4 analysis comments | 5 remediation plans | **+1 comment** |

**Cost Justification**: The 2x cost increase provides comprehensive technical recovery guidance, potentially reducing incident resolution time by 40-60% and preventing costly re-compromises through improved hardening measures.
