# Stakeholder Communication Template

## Template Purpose

After successful AI Foundry testing, this template enables Logic Apps automation to create **multi-audience security communications** for different organizational levels and stakeholder groups.

## ðŸ§ª Primary Testing Approach - AI Foundry Chat Interface

**Start here**: Test this template directly in Azure AI Foundry before Logic Apps integration to validate content quality and optimize token efficiency.

1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry**:
   - Access your AI Foundry deployment from the 02.03 lab
   - Select your **gpt-4o-mini** model deployment
   - Open the **Chat** interface

2. **Configure Testing Parameters**:

   ```json
   {
     "temperature": 0.2,
     "max_tokens": 400,
     "top_p": 0.95
   }
   ```

3. **Test System Message**:

   ```text

## Template Enhancement Context

Your AI Foundry model testing validated cybersecurity communication capabilities. Logic Apps integration adds **automated stakeholder communication** for:

- Multi-audience message generation from Defender XDR incidents.
- Audience-specific language adaptation and tone optimization.
- Risk communication frameworks for organizational stakeholders.
- Action item prioritization by audience responsibility and authority.

## Logic Apps Integration Quick Reference

This section provides the key data points needed to modify your Logic App being built in **02.06** to add stakeholder communication capabilities. The detailed implementation steps will be covered in lab **02.07**.

### AI Foundry System Message Update

**First, update your AI Foundry deployment** with the stakeholder communication system message from the testing section above. This ensures your model is optimized for multi-audience communication before Logic Apps integration.

1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry** â†’ Your deployment â†’ **Chat** interface
2. **Update System Message** with the comprehensive stakeholder communication prompt from the testing section
3. **Test the updated configuration** using the provided test scenarios
4. **Validate multi-audience output quality** before proceeding to Logic Apps integration

### Logic App Configuration

Update the **Analyze Incident with AI** action in the logic app to use the following settings:

#### Message Configuration - Stakeholder Communications

Replace your existing **messages** array with this JSON configuration for easy copy-paste:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst specializing in multi-stakeholder incident communication and crisis management. Your expertise includes rapid threat intelligence analysis using MITRE ATT&CK framework, business impact assessment across operational/financial/regulatory dimensions, and stakeholder-specific communication tailored to organizational roles. Focus on: Technical teams (immediate response procedures), Business leadership (operational continuity), Executive management (strategic risk assessment), Customer communications (service impact with reassurance), Regulatory compliance (notification requirements). Provide structured, audience-appropriate communications that enable effective organizational response while maintaining stakeholder trust."
  },
  {
    "role": "user", 
    "content": "Create multi-audience security communications for this Defender XDR incident: Title: [INCIDENT_TITLE], Description: [INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION], Severity: [INCIDENT_SEVERITY]. OUTPUT 5 SECTIONS: **TECHNICAL TEAMS:** Detailed procedures and immediate technical actions required **BUSINESS LEADERSHIP:** Operational impact assessment and resource coordination needs **EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT:** Strategic implications, decisions required, and cost estimates **CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION:** Service impact messaging with reassurance and transparency **REGULATORY COMMUNICATION:** Compliance obligations and formal notification requirements. REQUIREMENTS: Audience-appropriate language, consistent core facts, action-oriented messaging, professional tone, TOKEN LIMIT: 400 tokens maximum."
  }
]
```

### Expected AI Response Structure

The AI will return structured output in this format:

```text
**TECHNICAL TEAMS:** [Technical response content]

**BUSINESS LEADERSHIP:** [Business leadership content]

**EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT:** [Executive management content]

**CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION:** [Customer communication content]

**REGULATORY COMMUNICATION:** [Regulatory communication content]
```

### Comment Parsing Configuration

**Update your existing comment extraction actions** with this structured approach for stakeholder communications:

#### Update Extract AI Analysis Sections (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Extract AI Analysis Sections` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this stakeholder communication configuration:

```json
{
  "technicalTeams": "@{first(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**BUSINESS LEADERSHIP:**'))}",
  "businessLeadership": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**BUSINESS LEADERSHIP:**')), '**EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT:**'))}",
  "executiveManagement": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT:**')), '**CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION:**'))}",
  "customerCommunication": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION:**')), '**REGULATORY COMMUNICATION:**'))}",
  "regulatoryCommunication": "@{last(split(first(body('Analyze Incident with AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '**REGULATORY COMMUNICATION:**'))}"
}
```

#### Update Create Comments Array (Existing Compose Action)

In your existing `Create Comments Array` Compose action, **replace the current JSON content** with this stakeholder communication configuration:

```json
[
  {
    "prefix": "[Stakeholder - Technical]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['technicalTeams']}",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Stakeholder - Business]", 
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['businessLeadership']}",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Stakeholder - Executive]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['executiveManagement']}",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Stakeholder - Customer]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['customerCommunication']}",
    "order": 4
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[Stakeholder - Regulatory]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract AI Analysis Sections')['regulatoryCommunication']}",
    "order": 5
  }
]
```

### Cost Impact

| Metric | Default Setup | Stakeholder Template | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Cost per Incident** | ~$0.00018 | ~$0.00036 | **+$0.00018** (2x) |
| **Token Usage** | 180-200 tokens | 380-400 tokens | **+200 tokens** |
| **Execution Time** | 30-45 seconds | 90-150 seconds | **+60-105 seconds** |
| **Comments Generated** | 4 technical comments | 5 stakeholder communications | **+1 comment** |

**Cost Justification**: The 2x cost increase provides 5x communication value through multi-audience coverage, potentially reducing manual stakeholder communication costs by $500-2000 per major incident.
