Defender for Cloud ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Defender XDR Portal ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Logic Apps ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Azure OpenAI
     (Alert Source)      (Unified Interface)    (Automation)    (AI Analysis)
                                ‚îÇ
                                ‚ñº
                         Sentinel Workspace
                          (Data Foundation)
```

**Key Architectural Components:**

- **Defender XDR Portal**: Primary interface for incident management and AI analysis results
- **Sentinel Workspace**: Critical data repository providing advanced analytics and historical context
- **Logic Apps**: Automation bridge between unified portal incidents and AI analysis
- **Azure OpenAI**: AI-powered security analysis with cost-optimized token usage

### What are Logic Apps?

Logic Apps provide cloud-based workflow automation that connects disparate systems, data sources, and applications. For security operations, Logic Apps serve as the orchestration layer between Sentinel's security data and Azure OpenAI's AI analysis capabilities.

### Consumption vs. Standard Logic Apps

For security automation workloads, **Consumption Logic Apps** are recommended due to:

| Feature | Consumption | Standard | Recommendation |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Pricing Model** | Pay-per-execution | Fixed monthly cost | ‚úÖ **Consumption** - Variable security workloads |
| **Scale** | Automatic scaling | Manual scaling | ‚úÖ **Consumption** - Handles alert spikes |
| **Integration** | Native Azure connectors | Custom connectors | ‚úÖ **Consumption** - Sentinel/OpenAI connectors |
| **Security Scenarios** | Incident-driven workflows | High-volume processing | ‚úÖ **Consumption** - Alert-triggered analysis |
