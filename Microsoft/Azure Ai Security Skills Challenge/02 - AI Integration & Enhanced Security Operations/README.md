# Week 2 ‚Äì AI Integration & Enhanced Security Operations

This week focuses on implementing AI-driven capabilities within the Defender for Cloud infrastructure established in Week 1. The goal is to explore cost-effective AI integration patterns and build practical automation workflows that enhance security operations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement Azure OpenAI + Sentinel integration for cost-effective AI automation.
- Enable built-in AI features (UEBA, Fusion, Anomaly Detection) within existing deployments.
- Configure cost monitoring and alerts for AI services to stay within budget.
- Create foundational prompt templates for security scenarios.
- Simulate threat scenarios to observe AI-driven insights and responses.
- Begin building a prompt library that supports real-world security operations.
- Document AI integration patterns and cost optimization strategies.

## üìÅ Deliverables

- Azure OpenAI + Sentinel integration implemented using Logic Apps.
- Built-in AI features (UEBA, Fusion, Anomaly Detection) enabled and validated.
- Cost monitoring and alerting configured for AI services (within $150/month budget).
- Basic prompt templates created for:
  - Threat detection and alert triage
  - Security incident summarization
  - AI-assisted remediation guidance
- Simulated threat scenarios executed with AI analysis captured.
- AI integration guide and cost optimization strategies published.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] AI-driven security recommendations research completed (from Week 1).
- [ ] **Storage Account Deployment** - Deploy storage accounts for AI data processing, model storage, and logging.
- [ ] Azure OpenAI + Sentinel integration implemented (Logic Apps).
- [ ] Built-in AI features enabled (UEBA, Fusion, Anomaly Detection).
- [ ] Azure cost alerts configured for AI services.
- [ ] Basic AI prompt templates created for security scenarios.
- [ ] Benign threat scenario simulated with AI analysis.
- [ ] AI integration cost optimization strategies documented.
- [ ] Security Copilot research and on-demand usage strategy documented.
- [ ] AI integration guide published to GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Week 2 foundation prepared for Week 3 XDR integration.

> **üìã Infrastructure Note**: Storage accounts are required for AI workloads including data processing, model storage, and logging. These should be deployed early in Week 2 before implementing AI services.
