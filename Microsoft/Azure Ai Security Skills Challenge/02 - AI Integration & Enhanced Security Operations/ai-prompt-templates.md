# AI Prompt Templates for Security Operations

This document provides cost-optimized prompt templates for security scenarios. Each template is designed to maximize AI effectiveness while minimizing token usage and costs.

## üéØ Design Principles

### Cost Optimization
- **Maximum 500 tokens per response** to control costs
- **Temperature 0.3** for focused, consistent responses
- **Structured prompts** to reduce unnecessary tokens
- **Clear output format** to minimize back-and-forth interactions

### Security Focus
- **Actionable insights** for immediate security response
- **Risk-based prioritization** to focus on critical threats
- **False positive detection** to reduce alert fatigue
- **Integration ready** for Sentinel and Logic Apps automation

## üîß Integration Examples

### Logic Apps Integration

#### Sentinel Automation Prompt
```json
{
  "prompt": "Analyze this Sentinel incident: @{triggerBody()['properties']['description']}. Provide: 1) Summary, 2) Severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical), 3) Recommended actions, 4) False positive likelihood. Max 150 tokens.",
  "max_tokens": 150,
  "temperature": 0.3
}
```

#### Cost-Optimized Batch Processing
```json
{
  "prompt": "Analyze these 5 alerts in batch: @{variables('alertBatch')}. For each, provide: ID, Risk Level, Action Required (Y/N). Format: [ID]: [Risk] - [Y/N]. Max 200 tokens total.",
  "max_tokens": 200,
  "temperature": 0.2
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Management Guidelines

### Token Optimization Strategies

1. **Use Structured Formats**: Reduces tokens needed for parsing
2. **Limit Response Length**: Set maximum token limits for each prompt type
3. **Batch Multiple Requests**: Process multiple items in single requests
4. **Reuse Context**: Reference previous analysis when possible
5. **Avoid Repetitive Phrases**: Use abbreviations and concise language

### Cost Monitoring

| Template Type | Avg Tokens | Est. Cost/Use | Monthly Estimate* |
|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Alert Triage | 150 | $0.0003 | $9 (1000 alerts) |
| Incident Summary | 200 | $0.0004 | $12 (1000 incidents) |
| Risk Assessment | 100 | $0.0002 | $6 (1000 assessments) |
| Remediation | 300 | $0.0006 | $18 (1000 remediations) |

*Based on GPT-3.5-turbo pricing and estimated usage

### Budget Alerts Integration

```json
{
  "costThreshold": 0.01,
  "alertCondition": "Daily token usage exceeds $0.01",
  "action": "Send notification and reduce prompt frequency"
}
```

## üîç Template Validation

### Testing Prompts

Use these test scenarios to validate prompt effectiveness:

1. **Sample Malware Alert**: Test detection and response prompts
2. **Phishing Incident**: Validate incident summarization
3. **Network Anomaly**: Test risk assessment templates
4. **False Positive**: Verify false positive detection accuracy

### Performance Metrics

Track these metrics for prompt optimization:
- Response relevance (1-5 scale)
- Token efficiency (actual vs. target tokens)
- False positive detection rate
- Time to actionable insight

## üîó Advanced Integration Patterns

### Chained Prompts for Complex Analysis

```
1. Initial Triage ‚Üí Risk Level
2. If High Risk ‚Üí Detailed Analysis
3. If Critical ‚Üí Immediate Response Plan
4. All Levels ‚Üí Executive Summary
```

### Conditional Logic Integration

```json
{
  "condition": "@{outputs('Risk_Assessment')['risk_level']}",
  "high": "Execute detailed analysis prompt",
  "medium": "Execute standard analysis prompt", 
  "low": "Execute basic triage prompt"
}
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Clear role and task definitions
2. **Use Examples**: Include format examples in complex prompts
3. **Set Boundaries**: Explicit token and format limits
4. **Test Iteratively**: Refine prompts based on output quality
5. **Monitor Costs**: Track token usage per prompt type

### Security Considerations

1. **Sanitize Inputs**: Remove sensitive data before prompts
2. **Validate Outputs**: Human review for critical decisions
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all AI interactions for review
4. **Access Controls**: Restrict prompt modification permissions
