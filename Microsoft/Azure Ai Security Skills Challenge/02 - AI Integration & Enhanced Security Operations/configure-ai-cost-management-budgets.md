# Configure AI Cost Management & Budgets - End of Week Setup

This guide provides comprehensive budget and cost monitoring setup for your AI Security Skills Challenge infrastructure. Perform these steps **at the end of Week 2** after all resources have been deployed and have generated initial cost data.

## üéØ Overview

**When to Use This Guide:**
- At the end of Week 2 (after 24-48 hours of resource deployment)
- Before proceeding to Week 3 activities
- When planning for long-term resource management

**Why Separate Budget Setup:**
- Azure Cost Management requires 24-48 hours to recognize new resource groups
- Budget filters need existing cost data to populate resource options
- End-of-week timing ensures all resources are properly tracked

## üìã Prerequisites

Before configuring budgets, ensure:

- All Week 2 AI infrastructure has been deployed for at least 24-48 hours
- Resources have generated some cost data (even minimal usage)
- You have Cost Management Contributor permissions
- All resource groups and services are actively running

**Required Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ Resource group `rg-aisec-ai` with active resources
- ‚úÖ Storage account with containers and some usage
- ‚úÖ Azure OpenAI service (if deployed)
- ‚úÖ Logic Apps (if deployed)
- ‚úÖ Any additional AI services from Week 2

## üöÄ Step 1: Verify Resource Visibility

Before creating budgets, confirm all resources are visible in Cost Management.

### Check Cost Data Availability

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** in Azure Portal
2. Go to **Cost Management** ‚Üí **Cost analysis**
3. Set scope to your subscription
4. Apply filters:
   - **Resource group**: `rg-aisec-ai`
   - **Time range**: Last 7 days
5. Verify you see cost data for your deployed resources

### Validate Resource Group Filters

1. In **Cost analysis**, click **Add filter**
2. Select **Resource group**
3. Confirm `rg-aisec-ai` appears in the dropdown options
4. If not visible, wait another 24 hours and retry

---

## üí∏ Step 2: Create AI Foundation Budget

### Navigate to Budget Creation

1. In **Cost Management + Billing**, go to **Budgets**
2. Click **+ Add** to create a new budget

|---------|--------|
| **Scope** | Subscription |
| **Filters** | Service name: `Cognitive Services` |
| **Name** | `Azure OpenAI - AI Security Project` |
| **Amount** | `$50` |
| **Alerts** | 60%, 80%, 95% |

### Logic Apps Budget

For AI automation workflows:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Scope** | Subscription |
| **Filters** | Service name: `Logic Apps` |
| **Name** | `Logic Apps - AI Automation` |
| **Amount** | `$20` |
| **Alerts** | 70%, 85%, 95% |

## üìä Step 4: Configure Cost Monitoring

### Set Up Cost Alerts

Beyond budgets, configure subscription-level anomaly detection:

1. Go to **Cost Management** ‚Üí **Cost alerts**
2. Click **+ Add** ‚Üí **Anomaly alert**
3. Configure:
   - **Scope**: Subscription
   - **Alert name**: `AI Project Cost Anomaly`
   - **Email recipients**: Your contact information

### Weekly Cost Review Setup

Schedule regular cost reviews:

1. **Cost Analysis Saved Views**:
   - Create custom view: "AI Weekly Costs"
   - Filter by: Resource group `rg-aisec-ai`
   - Group by: Service name
   - Save and pin to dashboard

2. **Cost Export** (Optional):
   - Set up automated export for detailed analysis
   - Export scope: Resource group `rg-aisec-ai`
   - Schedule: Weekly on Sunday nights

## üéØ Step 5: Budget Management Best Practices

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**For Storage Accounts:**
- Monitor container usage patterns
- Consider cool tier for infrequently accessed AI models
- Review and clean up test data regularly

**For Azure OpenAI:**
- Track token usage and optimize prompts
- Use appropriate model tiers (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)
- Implement request throttling in applications

**For Logic Apps:**
- Optimize trigger frequency
- Use consumption vs standard pricing based on usage
- Review and consolidate workflow runs

### Ongoing Management

**Weekly Tasks:**
- Review cost trends in Cost Analysis
- Check budget alert emails and take action
- Verify resource usage aligns with project needs

**Monthly Tasks:**
- Adjust budget amounts based on usage patterns
- Review and optimize underutilized resources
- Update forecasts for upcoming project phases

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Budget Issues

### Resource Group Not Visible in Filters

**Symptoms**: `rg-aisec-ai` doesn't appear in budget filter dropdown

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 24-48 hours after resource creation
2. Verify resources have generated usage data
3. Check Cost Analysis shows resource group data
4. Create subscription-level budget with resource group filter instead

### Budget Alerts Not Triggering

**Symptoms**: Exceeding thresholds but no email alerts

**Solutions**:
1. Verify email addresses are correct in budget configuration
2. Check spam/junk folders for azure-noreply@microsoft.com
3. Add azure-noreply@microsoft.com to safe sender list
4. Test with lower threshold (e.g., 10%) to verify alert functionality

### Inaccurate Cost Forecasting

**Symptoms**: Forecast doesn't match actual usage patterns

**Solutions**:
1. Allow 30+ days for forecast accuracy improvement
2. Review and remove one-time setup costs from forecast period
3. Use actual cost alerts instead of forecasted for immediate response
4. Manually calculate expected monthly costs based on service pricing
