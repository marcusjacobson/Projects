# Decommission AI Storage Foundation - Lab Reset Guide

## üéØ Purpose and Scope

This comprehensive decommissioning guide provides a systematic approach to safely remove AI storage infrastructure from your Azure environment and restore your lab to a clean slate. This guide supports **two different decommissioning approaches** based on how you originally deployed the AI storage foundation.

## üöÄ Choose Your Decommissioning Method

### **Method 1: Automated Script Decommissioning** ‚ö° (Recommended)

**Use this method if you deployed using:**

- **Modular Infrastructure-as-Code Guide** (`deploy-ai-storage-foundation-modular-iac.md`)
- **PowerShell automation scripts** (`Deploy-StorageFoundation.ps1`)

**‚úÖ Advantages:**

- **Fast**: Complete decommissioning in ~1-2 minutes
- **Comprehensive**: 100% validation with complete resource cleanup
- **Safe**: Automated resource discovery and dependency handling
- **Cost-effective**: Immediate termination of all storage charges
- **Data Protection**: Optional data backup before deletion

**üöÄ Quick Start:**

```powershell
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd "scripts"

# Preview decommission (recommended first step)
.\Remove-AIStorageInfrastructure.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -WhatIf

# Run the automated decommission script
.\Remove-AIStorageInfrastructure.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -Force
```

### **Method 2: Manual Portal Decommissioning** üñ±Ô∏è

**Use this method if you deployed using:**

- **Azure Portal Manual Guide** (`deploy-ai-storage-foundation-azure-portal.md`)
- **Manual configuration through Azure Portal**
- **Step-by-step manual deployment**

**üìã Process:** Follow the detailed [manual decommissioning steps](#manual-portal-decommissioning-steps) below for systematic portal-based removal.

   - Click the container name
   - Select any important blobs
   - Click **Download** to save locally

### Step 2: Remove Storage Containers

Clean up the container structure:

#### Delete AI Containers

1. In your storage account, go to **Data storage** > **Containers**
2. Select the `ai-data` container
3. Click **Delete container**
4. Type the container name to confirm deletion
5. Repeat for `ai-logs` and `ai-models` containers

**Expected Result**: All three AI containers should be deleted

### Step 3: Remove Storage Account

Delete the main storage account:

#### Storage Account Deletion

1. Navigate back to **Storage accounts** in the main portal
2. Select your AI storage account (`stai{unique-id}`)
3. Click **Delete** in the top toolbar
4. In the confirmation dialog:
   - Type the storage account name to confirm
   - Check "I understand this will delete all data"
   - Click **Delete**

**‚è±Ô∏è Deletion Time**: 2-3 minutes for complete removal

### Step 4: Remove Budget and Cost Alerts

Clean up cost management configurations:

#### Budget Removal

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**
2. Go to **Cost Management** > **Budgets**
3. Find the AI storage budget (typically named `AI-Storage-Budget-{environment}`)
4. Select the budget and click **Delete**
5. Confirm deletion

#### Alert Cleanup

1. In **Cost Management**, go to **Alerts**
2. Remove any alerts related to AI storage
3. Verify no storage-related notifications remain

### Step 5: Remove Resource Group (Optional)

If the AI resource group is dedicated to storage only:

#### Resource Group Cleanup

1. Navigate to **Resource groups**

## üîç Post-Decommission Validation

### Cost Verification

Confirm that all storage-related charges have stopped:

#### Check Current Costs

1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**
2. Go to **Cost analysis**
3. Filter by resource group: `rg-{environment}-ai`
4. Verify no new charges are being incurred
5. Check that storage account costs have dropped to zero

### Resource Verification

Ensure complete cleanup:

#### Portal Verification

1. **Storage accounts**: Verify AI storage account no longer exists
2. **Resource groups**: Confirm AI resource group is empty or removed
3. **Budgets**: Check that storage budget is deleted
4. **Alerts**: Verify no storage-related alerts remain

#### CLI Verification (Optional)

```bash
# Check for remaining storage accounts
az storage account list --query "[?contains(name, 'stai')]"

# Verify resource group contents
az resource list --resource-group "rg-{environment}-ai"

# Check for remaining budgets
az consumption budget list --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/rg-{environment}-ai"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Decommission Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Storage Account Won't Delete**
```
Error: Storage account contains data or has active leases
Solution: Ensure all containers are empty and no services are accessing the storage
```

**Budget Deletion Fails**
```
Error: Budget is referenced by other resources
Solution: Remove all alert rules first, then delete the budget
```

**Resource Group Deletion Blocked**
```
Error: Resource group contains resources
Solution: Verify all resources are removed, check for hidden resources
```

**Automated Script Failures**

```powershell
# Check script permissions
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Verify Azure connection
Get-AzContext

# Run with detailed logging
.\Remove-AIStorageInfrastructure.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -Verbose -WhatIf
```
