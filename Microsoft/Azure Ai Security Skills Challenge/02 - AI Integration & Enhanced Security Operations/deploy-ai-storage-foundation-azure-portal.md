## Step 3: Cost Awareness

Understanding storage costs and planning for budget monitoring.

### üí∞ Storage Cost Overview

Monitor these cost components for your AI storage foundation:

| Component | Estimated Monthly Cost | Description |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Storage (LRS, Hot)** | $3-8 | Depending on data volume |
| **Operations** | $1-2 | Read/write operations |
| **Data Transfer** | $0-1 | Minimal for lab usage |
| **Total Estimate** | **$4-11/month** | Conservative estimate for lab usage |

### üìä Cost Management Setup

**‚è∞ Budget Setup Timing**: Due to Azure Cost Management's 24-48 hour latency for recognizing new resource groups, budget configuration should be performed **at the end of Week 2** when all resources have generated cost data.

**üîó Complete Budget Guide**: For comprehensive budget setup with alerts and monitoring, see **[Configure AI Cost Management & Budgets](./configure-ai-cost-management-budgets.md)**.

### ÔøΩ Immediate Cost Controls

While waiting for budget setup, implement these immediate cost controls:

1. **Monitor Usage**: Check **Cost Analysis** daily for the first week
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Remove any test resources after validation
3. **Access Pattern Review**: Ensure containers are set to **Private** access only
4. **Data Lifecycle**: Plan data retention policies for logs and temporary files

---

## Step 4: Validation & Testing

Verify your storage foundation is properly configured and ready for AI integration.

### üîê Prerequisites: Storage Data Access Permissions

Before testing storage connectivity, ensure you have the necessary data-level permissions. **Subscription Owner** role provides management access but not automatic data access to storage blobs.

#### Grant Storage Blob Data Contributor Role

1. In your storage account, navigate to **Access Control (IAM)** in the left menu
2. Click **+ Add** ‚Üí **Add role assignment**
3. **Role tab**:
   - Search for and select **Storage Blob Data Contributor**
   - Click **Next**
4. **Members tab**:
   - **Assign access to**: **User, group, or service principal**
   - Click **+ Select members**
   - Search for and select your user account
   - Click **Select**
   - Click **Next**
5. **Review + assign tab**:
   - Review the assignment details
   - Click **Review + assign**

**üí° Why This Permission is Needed:**

- **Subscription Owner**: Provides management plane access (create/delete resources)
- **Storage Blob Data Contributor**: Provides data plane access (read/write blob data)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Azure separates resource management from data access for security

#### Wait for Permission Propagation

- **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the role assignment to propagate.
- **Refresh your browser** or sign out/in if permission errors persist.

### ‚úÖ Storage Account Validation

#### Test Storage Connectivity

1. Navigate back to your storage account
2. Go to **Data storage** ‚Üí **Containers**
3. Click on the `ai-data` container
4. Click **Upload** to test access
5. Upload a small test file (create a simple .txt file)
6. Verify the upload completes successfully
7. Delete the test file to clean up

**üö® If Upload Still Fails:**

- Verify the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role was assigned correctly.
- Try using **Access keys** method: In the container, click **Switch to access key** at the top of the page.
- Wait additional 5-10 minutes for Azure AD propagation in some regions.

#### Verify Security Configuration

Check that security settings are properly applied:

1. From the main storage account menu, navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Configuration**
   - **Secure transfer required**: Should be **Enabled**
   - **Allow Blob anonymous access**: Should be **Disabled**
   - **Minimum TLS version**: Should be **Version 1.2**

2. Navigate to **Data storage** ‚Üí **Containers**
   - All containers should show **Private** access level

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Storage Account Name Already Exists

- Storage account names must be globally unique across all Azure.
- Try adding more unique characters: `stai` + `your-initials` + `MMDD` + `random-digits`.

#### Access Denied Errors

- Verify Contributor or Owner access to the subscription.
- Check you're signed in with the correct Azure account.
- Ensure resource group creation permissions.

#### Container Creation Fails

- Verify storage account deployment completed successfully.
- Check that blob service is enabled (default).
- Refresh the portal and try again.

#### Storage Data Access Errors

**Symptoms**: **You do not have permissions to list the data using your user account with Microsoft Entra ID** when uploading files

**Root Cause**: Subscription Owner role provides resource management access but not data-level access to storage blobs

**Solution**:

1. Navigate to **Access Control (IAM)** in your storage account.
2. Add role assignment: **Storage Blob Data Contributor** to your user account.
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for permission propagation.
4. Refresh browser or try **Switch to access key** option in container upload.
