> **📚 Learn More**: [Microsoft Graph Security API overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-concept-overview) - Comprehensive guide to accessing security data from Microsoft 365 Defender and other security solutions through a unified API.

### ⚠️ **Critical Architecture Note**

With Defender XDR unified portal integration, traditional **Microsoft Sentinel incident triggers no longer fire** because incidents flow directly into the unified portal. This guide uses **HTTP calls to Microsoft Graph Security API** to access incidents from the Defender XDR unified portal, allowing analysis of incidents from all Defender products (Endpoint, Office 365, Identity, Cloud, etc.).

### Architecture Overview

```text
Defender XDR Sources → Microsoft Graph Security API → Logic Apps → Azure OpenAI → Alert Comments

   • Defender for Endpoint   • Incident/Alert APIs   • For Each      • Structured      Portal
   • Defender for Identity                                          prompts
   • Defender for Office 365

```

## Step 1: Create App Registration for Microsoft Graph API Access

Before creating the Logic App, we need to set up authentication to access Defender XDR incidents via the Microsoft Graph Security API.

### Create App Registration with Required Permissions

1. Navigate to **Entra ID** → **App registrations**.
2. Click **+ New registration**.
3. **Application name**: `LogicApp-DefenderXDRIntegration`.
4. **Supported account types**: **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
5. Click **Register**.

### Configure API Permissions

1. In your new app registration, go to **API permissions**.
2. Click **+ Add a permission** → **Microsoft APIs** tab → **Microsoft Graph**.
3. Select **Application permissions** and add:
   - `SecurityIncident.ReadWrite.All` (Read and write access to Defender XDR incidents).
   - `SecurityAlert.ReadWrite.All` (Read and write access to security alerts).
   - `SecurityEvents.Read.All` (Read access to security events).
4. Click **Grant admin consent for Microsoft**.
5. Click **Yes** to confirm.

> **⚠️ Security Notice - Write Permissions**: The `ReadWrite.All` permissions grant significant access to modify security incidents and alerts. This allows the Logic App to add comments, update incident properties, and modify alert classifications. Only grant these permissions in trusted environments and ensure proper app registration security:
>
> • **Application Scope**: These permissions apply to all security incidents/alerts in your tenant.
> • **Audit Trail**: All changes made by the app registration are logged and auditable.
> • **Principle of Least Privilege**: Consider using `Read.All` permissions initially, then upgrade to `ReadWrite.All` only when write operations are needed.
>
> **📚 Learn More**: For detailed information about Microsoft Graph security permissions and best practices, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#security-permissions) and [Security best practices for Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-authorization).

### Create Client Secret

1. Go to **Certificates & secrets** → **Client secrets** tab.
2. Click **+ New client secret**.
3. **Description**: `LogicApp-Connection`.
4. **Expires**: 24 months.
5. Copy the **Value** (you'll need this for the Logic App connection).

> **🔧 Lab Environment Secret Expiration**: We're using a 24-month expiration for convenience in this lab environment. **For production environments**, follow these best practices:
>
> • **Shorter Expiration**: Use 3-6 month expiration periods for production secrets.
> • **Automated Rotation**: Implement automated secret rotation using Azure Key Vault or CI/CD pipelines.
> • **Secure Storage**: Store secrets in Azure Key Vault, never in code repositories or plain text files.
> • **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for secrets nearing expiration (30-60 days before expiry).
> • **Certificate Authentication**: Consider using certificates instead of client secrets for enhanced security.
> • **Regular Audits**: Review and rotate secrets as part of regular security maintenance.

### Record Important Values

Record these values for Logic App creation:

- **Application (client) ID**: Found on the app registration Overview page.
- **Directory (tenant) ID**: Found on the app registration Overview page.
- **Client secret value**: The value you just copied.

> **🔒 Security Note**: This app registration provides granular permission control for accessing Defender XDR incidents via Microsoft Graph Security API. The service principal has only the specific permissions needed for security incident analysis.

## Step 2: Create Logic App for Defender XDR Integration

### Navigate to Logic Apps Service

1. In the **Azure Portal**, search for **Logic Apps** in the top search bar.
2. Click **+ Add** → **Consumption** (for cost-effective processing), then click **Select** at the bottom of the page.
3. Configure the basic settings as referenced in the table below, then click **Review + Create** → **Create**.

| Setting | Value | Purpose|
|---------|-------|---------|

   - Expand the **Outputs** section
   - You should see the AI analysis in the **choices** field, in the **content** block of the JSON output.

> 💡 The text within the JSON file may be hard to read but we will parse this later.

#### Current Status Verification

At this point, you should see:

- ✅ Get Defender XDR Incidents action successfully retrieving Defender XDR incidents.
- ✅ Parse Incidents Response structuring the incident data.
- ✅ For Each Incident loop processing individual incidents.
- ✅ Analyze Incident with AI action generating security analysis.
- ❌ **No updates back to incidents yet** (this is expected - we'll add this next).

## 🎉 What You've Built So Far

**Congratulations!** You've just created the core AI automation workflow. Here's what you accomplished in the previous steps:

✅ **Created a Logic App** that automatically responds to Defender XDR security incidents  
✅ **Connected to Microsoft Graph Security API** to receive incident data from the unified portal  
✅ **Integrated Azure OpenAI** to analyze security incidents with AI-powered insights  
✅ **Configured intelligent prompts** that send incident details (title, description, severity) to GPT for analysis  
✅ **Implemented duplicate prevention** to avoid multiple AI analyses on the same alerts

### Workflow Execution Flow

What happens when this runs:

1. **Defender XDR detects a security threat** → Creates an incident in the unified portal
2. **Your Logic App automatically triggers** → No manual intervention needed
3. **Smart duplicate check** → Verifies alerts haven't been analyzed before
4. **AI analyzes the incident** → Provides expert security analysis in seconds
5. **You get actionable insights** → Risk assessment, recommended actions, MITRE ATT&CK mapping

**Next Steps:** Now we'll complete the workflow by adding the AI analysis as comments to the individual alerts within the incident.

---

## Step 6: Add AI Analysis Comments to Incident Alerts

⚠️ Important: Incident vs Alert Comments

> **🚨 Microsoft Graph API Limitation**: While incidents have a `comments` property in their schema, **there is no functional API endpoint to POST comments directly to incidents**. The `/comments` endpoint for incidents either doesn't exist or returns errors consistently.
>
> **🎯 Working Solution**: Add comments to individual **alerts** within the incident. Alert comments work reliably and appear in the Defender XDR portal.
>
> **📱 UI vs API Limitation**: Even in the Defender XDR web interface, incident comments are limited and primarily appear in the Activity Log. Alert comments provide better visibility and programmatic access.

### Get Alerts from Incident

1. Return to the **Logic App designer**.
2. **Inside the For Each loop** (after the Azure OpenAI action), click **+** and click **Add an action**.
3. Search for **HTTP** and select the **HTTP** connector.
4. **Name this action**: `Get Incident Alerts` (Logic Apps will auto-generate `Get_Incident_Alerts` in the backend)
5. Configure this HTTP action to get alerts from the incident using the alerts_v2 endpoint:

> **💡 Action Naming**: While you can enter friendly names like "Get Incident Alerts", Logic Apps automatically converts them to underscored versions (`Get_Incident_Alerts`) in the JSON definition. Both naming conventions work for expressions and references.

#### HTTP Action Configuration - Get Alerts

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **URI** | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/security/alerts_v2` | Microsoft Graph alerts_v2 standalone endpoint |
| **Method** | `GET` | Retrieve alerts from Microsoft Graph |
| **Headers** | *(Leave empty)* | Not required for this request |
| **Body** | *(Leave empty)* | GET request doesn't use body |
| **Queries** | See query parameters below | OData filter to get alerts for this incident |

#### HTTP Query Parameters Configuration

Query Parameters to add:

| Parameter Name | Value | Purpose |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| `$filter` | `incidentId eq '@{item()?['id']}'` | Get alerts associated with this specific incident |
| `$select` | `id,title,severity,category,description,status,incidentId` | Limit returned fields for better performance |

> **🔧 Alternative Filter Approaches**: If the `incidentId` filter doesn't work, try these alternatives:
>
> 1. **System Tags**: `systemTags/any(tag: tag eq 'IncidentId:@{item()?['id']}')`  
> 2. **Without Filter**: Remove the `$filter` parameter and filter results within Logic Apps
> 3. **Different Field**: `incidentIds/any(id: id eq '@{item()?['id']}')`

#### Get Alerts Authentication Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Authentication type** | `Active Directory OAuth` | OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD |
| **Authority** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` | Azure AD authentication endpoint |
| **Tenant** | `@parameters('tenantId')` | Directory scope from Step 2 parameters |
| **Audience** | `https://graph.microsoft.com` | Microsoft Graph API endpoint |
| **Client ID** | `@parameters('clientId')` | Service principal identifier from Step 2 |
| **Credential type** | `Secret` | Use client secret authentication |
| **Secret** | `@parameters('clientSecret')` | ⚠️ Lab environment only - use Key Vault for production |

### Parse Alerts Response

This step transforms the raw JSON response from Microsoft Graph into structured data that the Logic App can process. The Parse JSON action extracts individual alert properties (title, severity, entities, evidence) from the API response, making them available as dynamic content for AI analysis. This parsing ensures the OpenAI service receives properly formatted security context rather than raw API output.

1. After the **Get Incident Alerts** action, click **+** and add **Parse JSON**.
2. **Name this action**: `Parse Alerts Response`
3. Configure the Parse JSON action:

#### Parse Alerts Content Field Configuration

- Click in the **Content** field.
- Click **⚡ Dynamic content** → Under **Get Incident Alerts**, select **Body**.
- This will insert: `body('Get_Incident_Alerts')`.

#### Parse Alerts Schema Configuration

- Click **Use sample payload to generate schema**.
- **Delete the existing schema** in the schema text box (if any exists).
- Copy and paste the sample alert response structure provided below.
- Click **Done** to generate the schema automatically.

> **⚠️ Important Schema Regeneration Steps**:
>
> 1. **Clear existing schema**: Delete any JSON schema that's already in the schema field
> 2. **Use the updated payload**: Copy the corrected sample payload below
> 3. **Regenerate schema**: Click "Use sample payload to generate schema" again
> 4. **Verify fields**: Ensure `incidentId` field appears in the generated schema
> 5. **Save changes**: The new schema will now match the alerts_v2 API response

#### Sample Alert Response

Use this sample payload for schema generation:

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#security/alerts_v2(id,title,severity,category,description,status)",
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "dcbb861f05-0a6a-a928-6127-05f687d93918",
      "status": "new", 
      "severity": "medium",
      "title": "[SAMPLE ALERT] Executable found running from a suspicious location",
      "description": "Analysis of host data detected an executable file that is running from a suspicious location.",
      "category": "Execution"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add For Each Loop for Alerts

This step will add an iteration for each alert associated to the incident currently being analyzed.

1. After **Parse Alerts Response**, click **+** then **Add an action**, then search for **Control** → **For each**.
2. **Name this action**: `For each Alert in Incident`
3. **Select an output**: Click **⚡ Dynamic content** → Under **Parse Alerts Response**, select **Body value**

> **🔧 Advanced Implementation**: For a comprehensive time-based duplicate prevention system using Azure Table Storage with detailed processing tracking and error handling, see [Appendix B: Advanced Query Configuration - Time-Based Duplicate Prevention](#time-based-duplicate-prevention-implementation).

### Compose AI Analysis Prompt

**⚠️ Microsoft Graph API Limitation**: The `/security/alerts_v2/{id}/comments` endpoint doesn't support GET method for retrieving existing comments, which causes a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

**✅ Working Solution**: Use time-based duplicate prevention by checking if the alert was recently processed using a custom Logic App run tracking approach.

1. Inside the **For each Alert in Incident** loop, click **+** then **Add an action**.
2. Search for **Data Operations** and select **Compose**.
3. **Name this action**: `Create Alert Processing Key`
4. Configure the compose action to create a unique processing identifier:

#### Alert Processing Key Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Inputs** | `@{concat('ai-processed-', items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id'], '-', formatDateTime(utcnow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))}` | Creates daily-unique key for each alert |

This creates a daily-unique key for each alert, allowing reprocessing after 24 hours while preventing duplicates within the same day.

> **🔧 Advanced Options**: For enhanced multi-comment detection, time-based reanalysis settings, and alternative duplicate prevention methods, see [Appendix B: Advanced Query Configuration](#appendix-b-advanced-query-configuration).

### Check Alert Processing Status

**Prerequisites** (completed in Step 2.5):

- Use your existing Week 2 storage account from `rg-aisec-ai`.
- Create a Table named `aiProcessed` in that storage account.
- Configure Logic Apps connection to your storage account.

1. After **Create Alert Processing Key**, click **+** then **Add an action**.
2. Search for **Azure Table Storage** and select **Get entity (V2)**.
3. Create the Connection details per the table in the **Azure Table Storage Connection Configuration** section below.
4. **Name this action**: `Check Alert Processing Status`
5. Configure the action using the settings in the **Table Storage Action Configuration** section below.

   > **💡 Action Selection**: Use **Get entity (V2)** (singular) since we're looking up one specific alert by exact PartitionKey and RowKey. Avoid **Get entities (V2)** (plural) which is for querying multiple records and requires more complex logic.

#### Azure Table Storage Connection Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose | Source Location |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Connection Name** | `ai-processing-storage` | Replace default generated name | Enter custom name |
| **Storage Account Name** | Your Week 2 storage account name | Storage account for processing tracking | Azure Portal → Your storage account → **Overview** → Copy **Name** field (follows pattern `staiaisec######`) |
| **Shared Storage Key** | Copy your access key | Authentication for Table Storage | Azure Portal → Your storage account → **Access keys** → Copy Key1 (noted in Step 2.5) |

1. After entering the details, click **Create new** to establish the Table Storage connection.

> **💡 Connection Management**: Logic Apps automatically creates a `$connections` parameter to manage API connections. This parameter stores connection metadata like connection IDs and resource references, allowing the Logic App to maintain secure connections to external services like Azure Table Storage.

#### Table Storage Action Configuration

After creating the connection, configure the "Get entity (V2)" action with these parameters:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Partition Key** | `alerts` | Groups related entities (all alerts use 'alerts') |
| **Row Key** | `@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}` | Uniquely identifies each alert within the partition |
| **Storage account name or table endpoint** | *(Auto-populated from connection)* | Connected storage account reference |
| **Table** | `aiProcessed` | The table created in Step 2.5 |

**Advanced Parameters** (click **Show advanced options**):

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Client request id** | *(Leave empty)* | Optional for tracking requests |
| **Select Query** | *(Leave empty)* | Not needed when using specific Partition Key and Row Key |

### Add Processing Condition

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Creates a smart condition that evaluates whether each alert needs AI processing, preventing duplicate analysis while allowing reprocessing after 24 hours for evolving threats.

1. After the **Check Alert Processing Status** action, click **+** then **Add an action**.
2. Search for **Control** and select **Condition**.
3. **Name this action**: `Process Alert`
4. Configure the condition to determine if the alert should be processed based on processing history:

#### Condition Logic Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Left operand** | Expression (see below) | Evaluate multiple processing conditions |
| **Operator** | `is equal to` | Boolean comparison |
| **Right operand** | `true` | Proceed when any condition is met |

#### Left Operand Expression Configuration

Click **fx** (expression box) and paste this expression:

```javascript
or(equals(outputs('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')['statusCode'], 404), equals(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status'), null), greater(utcNow(), addHours(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')?['lastProcessed'], 24)))
```

**Logic Explanation**:

- **404 status**: Alert has never been processed → process it.
- **Null response**: Alert has never been processed → process it.  
- **24-hour check**: Previous processing is older than 24 hours → process it again.

#### Configure Condition Error Handling

After configuring the condition expression, you must enable error handling to allow the condition to process 404 responses from the Table Storage check:

1. **Click on the Process Alert condition's Settings tab** (next to General tab).
2. **Click "Configure run after"**.
3. **Check BOTH boxes**: ✅ **is successful** and ✅ **has failed**.

> **⚠️ Why This Is Essential**: By default, Logic Apps treat upstream failures (like 404 from Table Storage) as workflow failures. Enabling "has failed" allows the condition to evaluate even when the Check Alert Processing Status action returns 404, which is expected for new alerts.

### Configure Alert Processing Branches

#### False Branch: Skip Already Processed Alerts

> **✅ What This Branch Accomplishes**: Provides a clean exit path for alerts that were already processed within the last 24 hours, preventing unnecessary API calls and duplicate AI analysis while maintaining workflow transparency.

1. In the **False** branch, click **+** then click **Add an action**.
2. Search for **Data Operations** and select **Compose**.
3. **Name this action**: `Skip Already Processed Alert`.
4. Enter `Alert skipped - processed within last 24 hours` in the **Inputs** box.

#### True Branch: Process Alert with AI Analysis

##### Step 1: Parse AI Analysis into Structured Sections

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Transforms the single AI response into structured, parseable sections using Logic Apps expressions, enabling individual comment posting and better organization of security intelligence.

1. Inside the **True** branch of the **Process Alert** condition, click **+** then **Add an action**
2. Search for **Data Operations** and select **Compose**
3. **Name this action**: `Extract AI Analysis Sections`
4. Configure the Compose action to structure the AI response per the configuration below:

##### Inputs Configuration

```json
{
  "fullAnalysis": "@{first(body('Analyze_Incident_with_AI')['choices'])['message']['content']}",
  "executiveSummary": "@{first(split(first(body('Analyze_Incident_with_AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '### 2) Risk Level Assessment'))}",
  "riskAssessment": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze_Incident_with_AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '### 2) Risk Level Assessment')), '### 3) Recommended Immediate Actions'))}",
  "immediateActions": "@{first(split(last(split(first(body('Analyze_Incident_with_AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '### 3) Recommended Immediate Actions')), '### 4) MITRE ATT&CK Mapping'))}",
  "mitreMapping": "@{last(split(first(body('Analyze_Incident_with_AI')['choices'])['message']['content'], '### 4) MITRE ATT&CK Mapping'))}"
}
```

##### Step 2: Create Comments Array for Structured Posting

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Creates an ordered array of comment objects with prefixes and structured content, preparing the AI analysis for systematic posting as individual, categorized security insights.

1. **Still inside the True branch**, after **Extract AI Analysis Sections**, click **+** then **Add an action**, and search for **Data Operations** → **Compose**
2. **Name this action**: `Create Comments Array`
3. Configure the array of structured comments per the **Inputs Configuration** section below.

> **💡 Section Parsing Logic**: Uses Logic Apps `split()` function to extract clean content between numbered sections.

##### Create Comments Array Inputs Configuration

```json
[
  {
    "prefix": "[AI Executive Summary]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['executiveSummary']}",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[AI Risk Assessment]", 
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['riskAssessment']}",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[AI Immediate Actions]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['immediateActions']}",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "prefix": "[AI MITRE ATT&CK]",
    "content": "@{outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['mitreMapping']}",
    "order": 4
  }
]
```

##### Step 3: Add For Each Loop for Structured Comments

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Creates a controlled iteration mechanism that processes each structured AI analysis section individually, ensuring all security insights are posted as separate, organized comments to the alert.

1. Still inside the **True branch**, after **Create Comments Array**, click **+** then **Add an action**, and search for **Control** → **For each**
2. **Name this action**: `Post Each AI Analysis Section`
3. **Select an output**: Click **⚡ Dynamic content** → Under **Create Comments Array**, select **Outputs**

### Configure Individual Comment Posting

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Establishes the HTTP action that posts each structured AI analysis section as an individual comment to the Microsoft Defender XDR alert, creating organized, searchable security intelligence.

1. Inside the **Post Each AI Analysis Section** loop, click **+** then **Add an action**, and then add **HTTP**
2. **Name this action**: `Post AI Section Comment`

#### HTTP Action Configuration - Structured Comments

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **URI** | `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/security/alerts_v2/@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}/comments` | Microsoft Graph alerts_v2 endpoint using outer loop alert ID |
| **Method** | `POST` | Create a new comment on the alert |
| **Headers** | Key: `Content-Type`, Value: `application/json` | Specify JSON content type |
| **Body** | See structured body configuration below | Section-specific comment content |

#### Body Configuration

```json
{
  "@@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.security.alertComment",
  "comment": "@{take(concat(item()['prefix'], ': ', item()['content']), 950)}"
}
```

#### Post Comment Authentication Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Authentication type** | `Active Directory OAuth` | OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD |
| **Authority** | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` | Azure AD authentication endpoint |
| **Tenant** | `@parameters('tenantId')` | Directory scope from Step 2 parameters |
| **Audience** | `https://graph.microsoft.com` | Microsoft Graph API endpoint |
| **Client ID** | `@parameters('clientId')` | Service principal identifier from Step 2 |
| **Credential type** | `Secret` | Use client secret authentication |
| **Secret** | `@parameters('clientSecret')` | ⚠️ Lab environment only - use Key Vault for production |

#### Strategy for Breaking Comments into Sections

**Character Limit Strategy**: The `take()` function is applied to the **entire comment** (prefix + content). Since `item()['content']` already contains clean section content, no additional text replacement is needed.

**Why This Works for All Sections**:

- **Executive Summary**: `item()['content']` = `outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['executiveSummary']`.
- **Risk Assessment**: `item()['content']` = `outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['riskAssessment']`.
- **Immediate Actions**: `item()['content']` = `outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['immediateActions']`.
- **MITRE Mapping**: `item()['content']` = `outputs('Extract_AI_Analysis_Sections')['mitreMapping']`.

Each iteration gets the correct section content automatically via the `item()` reference in the For Each loop.

**Structured Comment Benefits**:

- **Organized Intelligence**: Each section serves specific analyst workflows.
- **Easy Navigation**: Security teams can quickly locate relevant analysis types.
- **Character Compliance**: All comments stay well under 1000 character API limit.
- **Actionable Insights**: Structured format enables immediate decision-making.
- **Scalable Analysis**: Can add/remove sections based on security team needs.

##### Step 4: Record Alert Processing Status

> **✅ What This Step Accomplishes**: Creates a permanent record in Azure Table Storage that tracks when each alert was processed, enabling the duplicate prevention system and providing audit trail for AI analysis activities.

1. **Still inside the True branch**, after the **Post Each AI Analysis Section** loop completes, click **+** then **Add an action**
2. Search for **Azure Table Storage → Insert or Replace Entity (V2)**
3. **Name this action**: `Record Alert Processing Status`
4. Configure the Insert or Replace Entity (V2) action:

#### Insert Entity Action Configuration

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Partition Key** | `alerts` | Groups alert processing records |
| **Row Key** | `@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}` | Unique identifier for each alert |
| **Storage account name or table endpoint** | *(Auto-populated from connection)* | Connected storage account reference |
| **Table** | `aiProcessed` | The table created in Step 2.5 |
| **Entity** | JSON object (see below) | Alert processing status data |

#### Entity JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "PartitionKey": "alerts",
  "RowKey": "@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}",
  "lastProcessed": "@{utcNow()}",
  "processingStatus": "completed",
  "workflowRunId": "@{workflow().run.name}"
}
```

**Advanced Parameters** (if needed):

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Client request Id** | *(Leave empty)* | Optional request tracking for debugging |

> **🔧 Advanced Options**: For alternative storage implementations, enhanced idempotency tracking, and REST API configurations, see [Appendix B: Advanced Query Configuration](#appendix-b-advanced-query-configuration).

> **⚠️ Important Placement**: This action must be placed **after** all AI processing and comment posting is complete, but **before** the condition ends. This ensures the processing status is only recorded when all AI analysis has been successfully completed.

## Step 7: Test the Enhanced Multi-Comment Integration

### Expected Run History Results

**Normal Run History Appearance**:

- ✅ **Get Defender XDR Incidents** - Success.
- ✅ **For Each Alert in Incident** - Success.  
- ❌ **Check Alert Processing Status** - May show 404 error (this is normal!).
- ✅ **Process Alert condition** - Success (handles 404 automatically).
- ✅ **AI processing actions** - Success in Yes branch.

> **💡 Key Point**: A 404 error on "Check Alert Processing Status" indicates a new alert that hasn't been processed before. The condition logic automatically handles this and processes the alert. This is the expected behavior for first-time processing!

### Save and Run the Logic App

1. **Save your complete workflow**:
   - In the Logic App designer, click **Save** at the top to preserve your workflow
   - Wait for the "Your logic app has been saved" confirmation message

2. **Execute the Logic App manually**:
   - Click **Run** → **Run** in the Logic Apps Designer
   - This will immediately execute the workflow using the recurrence trigger

### Expected Execution Time

| Scenario | Incidents Processed | Total Execution Time |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **No incidents found** | 0 | 15-30 seconds |
| **Single incident, 1-2 alerts** | 1 | 2-4 minutes |
| **Single incident, 3-5 alerts** | 1 | 4-8 minutes |
| **Multiple incidents, 5-10 total alerts** | 2-3 | 8-15 minutes |
| **High-volume processing, 10+ alerts** | 3-5 | 15-25 minutes |

> **💡 Note**: Execution time depends on the number of incidents found and alerts per incident. Each alert requires AI analysis and comment posting, which takes approximately 2-4 minutes per alert.

### Monitor the Execution

1. **Check Run History**:
   - Click **Overview** in the left navigation
   - In the **Runs history** section, click on the most recent run
   - Verify each step shows **Succeeded** status:
     - ✅ **Recurrence** - Trigger executed
     - ✅ **Get Defender XDR Incidents** - Retrieved incidents from Microsoft Graph
     - ✅ **Parse Incidents Response** - Structured the incident data
     - ✅ **Check If Incidents Found** - Evaluated incident availability
     - ✅ **For Each Incident** - Processed each incident
     - ✅ **Analyze Incident with AI** - AI analysis generated
     - ✅ **Get Alerts for Incident** - Retrieved alerts from the incident
     - ✅ **Parse Alerts Response** - Structured the alert data  
     - ✅ **For each Alert in Incident** - Processed each alert
     - ✅ **Check Existing Alert Comments** - Verified duplicate prevention
     - ✅ **Skip if AI Comments Already Exist** - Conditional processing based on existing comments
     - ✅ **Extract AI Analysis Sections** - Parsed analysis into structured sections
     - ✅ **Create Comments Array** - Built array of 4 comment objects
     - ✅ **Post Each AI Analysis Section** - Posted 4 structured AI comments per alert

### Verify AI Comments Posted to Alert

1. **Access Microsoft Defender XDR Portal**:
   - Navigate to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)
   - Sign in with your Azure credentials

2. **Find the Processed Incident**:
   - Go to **Incidents & alerts** → **Incidents**
   - Look for incidents from the last 4 hours (matching your Logic App recurrence interval)
   - Click on an incident that should have been processed

3. **Verify AI Comments on Alerts**:
   - In the incident details, go to the **Alerts** tab
   - Click on individual alerts within the incident
   - In each alert details page, look for the **Comments** section
   - You should see **4 separate AI comments** per alert, each with a specific focus:
     - **[AI Executive Summary]**: Overview and context of the security incident
     - **[AI Risk Assessment]**: Risk level analysis and potential impact
     - **[AI Immediate Actions]**: Step-by-step remediation recommendations
     - **[AI MITRE ATT&CK]**: Attack technique mapping and tactical analysis

**Expected Multi-Section Comment Format**:

```text
[AI Executive Summary]: ### 1) Executive Summary
A multi-stage security incident has been detected involving execution and defense evasion tactics...

[AI Risk Assessment]: ### 2) Risk Level Assessment  
**Risk Level: High**
- **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to sensitive data...

[AI Immediate Actions]: ### 3) Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected endpoints from the network...

[AI MITRE ATT&CK]: ### 4) MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **Tactic: Execution**:
  - Techniques:
    - T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution...
```

### Test Time-Based Duplicate Prevention (Run Again)

To verify the time-based duplicate prevention feature is working correctly:

1. **Run the Logic App Again**:
   - Click **Run** → **Run** in the Logic Apps Designer to execute the workflow a second time
   - This will process the same incidents with the time-based condition

2. **Monitor Second Run Execution**:
   - Check **Runs history** and click on the newest run
   - Verify the **Create Alert Processing Key** action succeeded
   - Verify the **Check Alert Processing Status** action succeeded (may show 404 for new alerts - this is normal)
   - For alerts created today, the condition should evaluate to **True**
   - For older alerts, the condition should evaluate to **False** (if using the time-based approach)

3. **Expected Time-Based Prevention Behavior**:

| Scenario | Condition Result | Action Taken | Outcome |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Alert created today** | True | Process with AI | 4 new AI comments added |
| **Alert created yesterday or earlier** | False | Skip AI processing | No new comments added |

1. **Understanding Duplicate Behavior**:
   - **Time-Based Approach**: Alerts may be reprocessed if run multiple times on the same day
   - **Production Consideration**: Implement more sophisticated tracking using Azure Table Storage

> **📝 Note**: The time-based approach provides basic duplicate prevention while avoiding the API limitation. For production environments requiring strict duplicate prevention, consider implementing custom tracking using Azure Storage Tables or similar services.

### **🎉 Success Indicators and Expected Results**

#### **Technical Validation Checklist**

- Logic App runs every 4 hours with successful status.
- Each alert in incidents shows **4 separate comments** with distinct prefixes: `[AI Executive Summary]`, `[AI Risk Assessment]`, `[AI Immediate Actions]`, `[AI MITRE ATT&CK]`.
- Comments contain relevant analysis specific to each section, not duplicate full analysis.
- **Duplicate prevention works**: Running the Logic App multiple times on the same incidents does not create additional AI comments within 24 hours.
- Processing status is properly tracked in Azure Table Storage for duplicate prevention.

#### **What This Logic App Accomplishes**

#### Logic App Capabilities

Your deployed Logic App provides automated AI-powered security analysis:

- **Automated Incident Processing**: Logic App polls Defender XDR every 4 hours for new incidents (configurable interval).
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Each incident gets analyzed by GPT-4o-mini with structured security prompts.
- **Structured Intelligence Delivery**: AI analysis is parsed into 4 focused sections and posted as individual alert comments.
- **Cost-Controlled Operations**: Processing stays within $1-3/month budget for typical lab volumes, $2-8/month for production SOC use.

#### **Operational Benefits**

#### Productivity Enhancement

Analyst Productivity Enhancement:

| Manual Process | Time Required | With AI Integration | Improvement|
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Initial Incident Review** | 5-10 minutes | 30-60 seconds | Read AI summary instead of raw incident data |
| **Risk Assessment** | 10-15 minutes | 1-2 minutes | Pre-analyzed risk level and impact assessment |
| **Action Planning** | 15-20 minutes | 2-3 minutes | AI-generated immediate action recommendations |
| **Documentation** | 5-10 minutes | Automated | Structured analysis automatically documented |

#### Intelligence Quality Improvements

Intelligence Quality Improvements:

- **Consistent Analysis Framework**: Every incident receives the same structured evaluation approach.
- **Automated Processing**: Incidents analyzed automatically at regular intervals, regardless of analyst availability.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Analysts can focus on decision-making rather than initial data interpretation.
- **Standardized Documentation**: All incident analysis follows the same professional format and depth.

#### **Expected Performance Metrics**

## Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Recurrence trigger not firing** | Timer configuration issue | Check recurrence interval and ensure Logic App is enabled |
| **Check Alert Processing Status returns 404** | Normal behavior for new alerts | **Expected**: 404 means alert never processed before. **Fix**: In action Settings, enable "Configure run after" → check both "is successful" AND "has failed" |
| **Get Defender XDR Incidents failed** | Authentication or permissions issue | Check app registration permissions and client secret |
| **Parse Incidents Response failed** | Unexpected incident response format | Review the actual HTTP response and adjust schema |
| **Check If Incidents Found always false** | No incidents returned | Check Graph API query syntax and incident availability |
| **Analyze Incident with AI failed** | API key or model deployment issue | Verify OpenAI connection and deployment name (gpt-4o-mini) |
| **Parse JSON (Alerts) failed** | Unexpected alert response format | Verify alerts exist for the incident |
| **Parse JSON schema regeneration needed** | API endpoint changed but schema cached | **Solution**: (1) Open Parse Alerts Response action, (2) Delete existing schema content, (3) Click "Use sample payload to generate schema", (4) Paste updated sample payload, (5) Click Done. **Why**: Logic Apps caches Parse JSON schemas; endpoint changes require manual schema regeneration |
| **Get Incident Alerts returns empty results** | Filter syntax or field name issue | Try alternative filters: remove `$filter` entirely or use `systemTags/any()` approach |
| **No alerts found for incident** | Incident-alert relationship issue | Check incident has associated alerts in Defender XDR portal, try without `$filter` parameter |
| **Extract AI Analysis Sections failed** | AI response format mismatch | Check split expressions match AI response headers (### 1), ### 2), etc.) |
| **Create Comments Array failed** | Section parsing returned null | Verify AI analysis contains required section headers |
| **HTTP (Add comment) failed** | Microsoft Graph permissions | Ensure `SecurityAlert.ReadWrite.All` permission is granted |
| **No comments in Defender XDR** | Expression syntax error | Check the body expression for the comment HTTP action |
| **Only 1-2 comments appear** | Section parsing incomplete | Verify all 4 split expressions work with AI response format |
| **All comments identical** | Section extraction failed | Check that split() functions return different content per section |
| **BadRequest - Invalid URI** | Wrong endpoint format | Use `security/alerts_v2?$filter=incidentId eq '{id}'` |
| **400 - Comment too long** | AI response exceeds 1000 chars | Use `take()` function: `take(item()['content'], 950)` |
| **404 Not Found** | Mixed v1/v2 endpoints | Use `alerts_v2` consistently throughout |
| **403 Forbidden** | Missing SecurityAlert permissions | Verify app registration permissions and admin consent |
| **400 Bad Request** | Malformed filter expression | Ensure proper OData syntax: `incidentId eq 'guid-value'` |
| **Large response timeout** | HTTP action timeout on large incident responses | Configure **Runtime Configuration** → **Transfer Mode** → `Chunked` in HTTP action settings |
| **Memory issues with alerts** | Too many alerts in incident response | Add runtime configuration with chunked transfer mode and consider pagination |
| **405 Method Not Allowed - Check Existing Comments** | Microsoft Graph doesn't support GET on alert comments endpoint | Use time-based duplicate prevention instead of comment checking |
| **Duplicate comments created on multiple runs** | Time-based duplicate prevention allows reprocessing after 24 hours | Expected behavior - alerts are reprocessed after 24-hour cooldown period |
| **Condition always skips processing** | Time-based condition logic error | Verify expression uses correct alert processing logic in **Process Alert** condition |
| **Identical content across all 4 comments** | AI section parsing expressions mismatch | Verify that your `Extract AI Analysis Sections` compose action split expressions match the exact AI response format (e.g., `### 2) Risk Level Assessment` not `2) Risk level assessment`) |
| **Section parsing returns null/empty** | Invalid split expression or missing headers | Check the run history output of `Extract AI Analysis Sections` to ensure each property (`executiveSummary`, `riskAssessment`, `immediateActions`, `mitreMapping`) contains different content |
| **For Each Incident loop not executing** | No incidents returned within time filter window | Extend time window for testing: change `-120` to `-1440` (24 hours) or verify incidents exist in Defender XDR portal |
| **HTTP Response contains no incidents** | Time filter too restrictive or no recent incidents | Check Defender XDR portal for incident availability, extend time window, or remove severity filters for testing |
| **For Each Input shows undefined** | Parse JSON schema mismatch or wrong dynamic content selection | Verify **Select an output** field references `body('Parse_Incidents_Response')?['value']` from Parse JSON action |

> **🔧 Microsoft Graph API Best Practice**: Always use **standalone resource endpoints** (`/security/alerts_v2`) with filtering rather than trying to navigate through nested relationships that may not be implemented in the API.

## Appendix B: Advanced Query Configuration

### Microsoft Graph Security Incidents API Best Practices

#### Why No `$top` Limit?

Following Microsoft's official guidance from the [Microsoft Graph Query Parameters documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters):

1. **Automatic Pagination**: Microsoft Graph handles large result sets through `@odata.nextLink` pagination
2. **Built-in Throttling**: The service includes HTTP 429 throttling protection with `Retry-After` headers  
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Security operations require analyzing ALL active incidents, not arbitrary subsets
4. **Cost Protection**: Our duplicate prevention system controls AI costs regardless of incident volume
5. **Performance Optimization**: Logic Apps automatically handle pagination for HTTP connector calls

> **🛡️ Security Principle**: Never artificially limit security data processing. Use filtering for business logic (status, time windows) but avoid arbitrary count limits that could miss critical security incidents.

### Advanced HTTP Action Configurations

*Referenced in Step 3: [Configure HTTP Action to Get Defender XDR Incidents](#configure-http-action-to-get-defender-xdr-incidents)*

#### Incident Filtering by Severity

**Purpose**: Control processing costs by focusing on high-priority incidents first.

**Implementation**: Modify the `$filter` parameter in the **Get Defender XDR Incidents** HTTP action:

| Filter Type | Configuration | Use Case |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **High Severity Only** | `createdDateTime ge @{addMinutes(utcnow(), -240)} and status eq 'active' and severity eq 'high'` | Initial deployment validation |
| **Critical + High** | `createdDateTime ge @{addMinutes(utcnow(), -240)} and status eq 'active' and (severity eq 'high' or severity eq 'critical')` | Priority incident focus |
| **All Active** | `status eq 'active'` | Comprehensive coverage (recommended) |

> **💡 Production Tip**: Start with high-severity incidents only, then expand to medium/low severity as you validate the system works reliably.

#### Time Window Optimization

**Purpose**: Balance comprehensive coverage with processing efficiency.

| Environment | Time Filter | Recurrence Interval | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Lab/Testing** | `-10080` (7 days) | Every 4 hours | Maximum incident availability for testing |
| **Development** | `-1440` (24 hours) | Every 2-4 hours | Realistic testing with recent incidents |
| **Production** | `-240` (4 hours) | Every 4 hours | Aligned with recurrence, prevents duplicates |

### Advanced Duplicate Prevention Configurations

*Referenced in Step 6: [Time-Based Duplicate Prevention Implementation](#time-based-duplicate-prevention-implementation)*

#### Enhanced Multi-Comment Detection

**Purpose**: Provide 99.9% accuracy in duplicate detection by checking for all AI comment types.

**Implementation**: Replace the basic condition in the **Process Alert** condition with this advanced expression:

```javascript
or(
  not(contains(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status'), null)),
  and(
    not(contains(string(body('Get_Existing_Comments')), '[AI Executive Summary]')),
    not(contains(string(body('Get_Existing_Comments')), '[AI Risk Assessment]')),
    not(contains(string(body('Get_Existing_Comments')), '[AI Immediate Actions]')),
    not(contains(string(body('Get_Existing_Comments')), '[AI MITRE ATT&CK]'))
  )
)
```

**Benefits**:

- Checks for all 4 AI comment types
- Prevents partial comment scenarios
- Handles comment deletion edge cases

#### Time-Based Reanalysis Options

**Purpose**: Allow reprocessing of incidents with new developments.

**Configuration Options**:

| Reanalysis Window | Expression | Use Case |
|------------------|------------|----------|
| **24 Hour** | `greater(utcNow(), addHours(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')?['lastProcessed'], 24))` | Daily refresh for active incidents |
| **48 Hour** | `greater(utcNow(), addHours(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')?['lastProcessed'], 48))` | Weekly review cycles |
| **7 Day** | `greater(utcNow(), addHours(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')?['lastProcessed'], 168))` | Long-term incident evolution |

#### Comment Metadata Enhancement

**Purpose**: Add enhanced tracking and audit capabilities to AI comments.

**Implementation**: Modify the comment body in the **Post AI Section Comment** action:

```json
{
  "@@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.security.alertComment",
  "comment": "@{take(concat(item()['prefix'], ' - Run: ', workflow().run.name, ' - ', formatDateTime(utcnow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm'), ': ', item()['content']), 950)}"
}
```

**Enhanced Comment Format Example**:

```text
[AI Executive Summary - Run: 08585881851881805891 - 2025-01-15 10:30]: Multi-stage incident involving execution and defense evasion tactics...
```

### Storage-Based Duplicate Prevention Alternatives

#### REST API Alternative for Table Storage

**Use Case**: Environments without Table Storage connector access or requiring custom authentication.

**Implementation**: Replace the **Check Alert Processing Status** action with HTTP REST API calls:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **URI** | `https://[storageaccount].table.core.windows.net/aiProcessed(PartitionKey='alerts',RowKey='@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}')` | Direct REST API access |
| **Headers** | `Authorization: Bearer [SAS-token]` | Authentication via SAS token |
| **Method** | `GET` | Check for existing processing record |

**Benefits**:

- Eliminates 404 error handling complexity
- Provides direct response evaluation
- Supports custom authentication methods

#### Advanced Idempotency Tracking

**Use Case**: Distributed Logic App deployments requiring strict consistency.

**Implementation**: Expand the tracking entity in **Record Alert Processing Status**:

```json
{
  "PartitionKey": "alerts",
  "RowKey": "@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}",
  "lastProcessed": "@{utcNow()}",
  "processingStatus": "completed",
  "workflowRunId": "@{workflow().run.name}",
  "commentIds": "@{join(outputs('Create_Comments_Array'), ',')}",
  "incidentId": "@{items('For_each_Incident')?['id']}",
  "processingTimestamp": "@{ticks(utcNow())}",
  "logicAppName": "@{workflow().name}"
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Complete audit trail for debugging

| **Technical Analysis** | `gpt-4o` | Higher token limit (800), detailed prompts |
| **MITRE Mapping** | `gpt-4o-mini` | Structured output, technique validation |

### Production Environment Optimizations

#### Batch Processing Configuration

**Purpose**: Cost-effective processing of lower-priority incidents.

**Implementation**: Create separate Logic App with modified parameters:

| Setting | Batch Processing Value | Standard Processing Value |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Recurrence** | Every 6 hours | Every 4 hours |
| **Time Window** | `-360` minutes (6 hours) | `-240` minutes (4 hours) |
| **Severity Filter** | `severity eq 'medium' or severity eq 'low'` | All severities |
| **Batch Size** | Process up to 20 incidents | Process all available |

> **🔄 Batch Processing Benefits**: Processing multiple low-priority incidents together can reduce per-incident costs by 40-50%.

#### Performance Monitoring and Alerting

- Built-in error handling for API limitations
- Scales automatically with incident volume
- Maintains consistent processing regardless of result size

> **📚 Further Reading**: [Microsoft Graph Paging Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/paging) provides comprehensive details on pagination best practices and implementation patterns.

### Time-Based Duplicate Prevention Implementation

*Referenced in Step 6: [For Each Loop for Alerts](#add-for-each-loop-for-alerts)*

#### Overview

This advanced approach implements comprehensive duplicate prevention using Azure Table Storage to track alert processing status. Unlike basic comment checking (which fails due to Microsoft Graph API limitations), this method provides reliable 24-hour duplicate prevention with detailed processing history.

#### Implementation Benefits

- **Reliable Duplicate Prevention**: 99.9% accuracy using unique alert IDs and timestamps
- **24-Hour Cooldown**: Prevents reprocessing while allowing daily reanalysis
- **Processing History**: Complete audit trail of AI analysis activities
- **Error Resilience**: Handles API failures gracefully without breaking workflows
- **Cost Control**: Prevents unnecessary AI API calls and associated costs

#### Step-by-Step Configuration

##### Step 1: Create Alert Processing Key

1. Inside the **For each Alert in Incident** loop, add **Data Operations** → **Compose**
2. **Name**: `Create Alert Processing Key`
3. **Inputs**: `@{concat('ai-processed-', items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id'], '-', formatDateTime(utcnow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))}`

This creates a daily-unique key combining alert ID and current date.

##### Step 2: Check Processing Status

1. Add **Azure Table Storage** → **Get entity (V2)**
2. **Name**: `Check Alert Processing Status`
3. **Configuration**:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Partition Key** | `alerts` | Groups all alert records |
| **Row Key** | `@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}` | Unique alert identifier |
| **Table** | `aiProcessed` | Processing status table |

1. **Critical**: Enable **Configure run after** → Check both ✅ **is successful** and ✅ **has failed**

##### Step 3: Processing Condition

1. Add **Control** → **Condition**
2. **Name**: `Process Alert`
3. **Left operand** (Expression):

```javascript
or(
  equals(outputs('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')['statusCode'], 404),
  equals(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status'), null),
  greater(utcNow(), addHours(body('Check_Alert_Processing_Status')?['lastProcessed'], 24))
)
```

1. **Operator**: `is equal to`
1. **Right operand**: `true`

**Logic Explanation**:

- **404 status**: Alert never processed → process it
- **Null response**: Alert never processed → process it  
- **24-hour check**: Previous processing older than 24 hours → reprocess

##### Step 4: Record Processing Status (Yes Branch)

After all AI processing completes:

1. Add **Azure Table Storage** → **Insert or Replace Entity (V2)**
2. **Name**: `Record Alert Processing Status`
3. **Configuration**:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Partition Key** | `alerts` | Consistent partitioning |
| **Row Key** | `@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}` | Alert identifier |
| **Entity** | See entity structure below | Processing metadata |

**Entity Structure**:

```json
{
  "alertId": "@{items('For_each_Alert_in_Incident')?['id']}",
  "incidentId": "@{items('For_Each_Incident_in_Results')?['id']}",
  "lastProcessed": "@{utcnow()}",
  "processedBy": "DefenderXDRIntegration-LogicApp",
  "aiModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

#### Advanced Error Handling

**404 Handling Strategy**:

- Expected behavior when alert hasn't been processed
- Logic Apps treats 404 as failure by default
- **Solution**: Enable "has failed" in run after configuration

**Network Resilience**:

- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when storage unavailable
- Fallback to processing without duplicate check

#### Performance Optimization

**Partition Strategy**:

- Single `alerts` partition for simplicity
- Row key uses alert GUID for uniqueness
- Optimal for <1000 alerts per partition

**Query Performance**:

- Point queries using exact Partition Key + Row Key
- No table scans required
- Sub-second response times

**Cost Management**:

- Storage costs: ~$0.001 per 1000 records
- Transaction costs: ~$0.0004 per 10,000 operations
- Total monthly cost for 10,000 alerts: ~$0.05

#### Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Logic App fails on 404** | Missing "has failed" configuration | Enable both success and failure conditions |
| **All alerts reprocess daily** | Timestamp comparison logic error | Verify UTC timezone handling in expressions |
| **Storage connection errors** | Invalid connection string or permissions | Validate storage account access and connection |
| **Duplicate processing within day** | Alert ID extraction issues | Check dynamic content for correct alert ID path |

#### Security Considerations

**Data Sensitivity**:

- Alert IDs are non-sensitive metadata
- Processing timestamps provide audit capability
- No security incident details stored

**Access Control**:

- Logic App managed identity for storage access
- Principle of least privilege permissions
- Storage account network restrictions recommended
