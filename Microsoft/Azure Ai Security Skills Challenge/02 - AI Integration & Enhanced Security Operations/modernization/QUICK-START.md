# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Modernized AI Security Challenge

## **Core Implementation Steps**

### **1. Infrastructure Deployment**
```powershell
cd ".\scripts"
.\Deploy-Complete.ps1 -UseParametersFile
```

### **2. Unified Security Operations Setup**
- Navigate to [Microsoft Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com)
- Connect Sentinel workspace to unified operations
- Enable cross-product correlation and unified incident management
- Deploy modern AI detection rules with automated investigation

### **3. Modernization Validation**
```powershell
.\Test-UnifiedSecurityReadiness.ps1 -UseParametersFile -DetailedReport
```

**Target:** 5/5 readiness score with all modern capabilities operational
