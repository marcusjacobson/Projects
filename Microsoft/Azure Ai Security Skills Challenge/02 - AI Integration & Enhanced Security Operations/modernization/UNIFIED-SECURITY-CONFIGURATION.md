   | where FailedAttempts > 10;
   
   let deviceAlerts = AlertInfo
   | where Timestamp > ago(1h)
   | where ServiceSource == "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint"
   | project AccountName = extractjson("$.AccountName", AdditionalFields);
   
   suspiciousSignIns
   | join kind=inner deviceAlerts on AccountName
   | project AccountName, IPAddress, FailedAttempts, AlertTitle
   ```

   **B. Advanced Multi-Stage Attack Detection**
   ```kql
   // Replaces legacy Fusion with enhanced correlation
   AlertInfo
   | where Timestamp > ago(24h)
   | where Severity in ("High", "Medium")
   | extend AttackStage = case(
       Title contains "Initial Access", "Stage1_InitialAccess",
       Title contains "Privilege Escalation", "Stage2_PrivEsc", 
       Title contains "Lateral Movement", "Stage3_LateralMovement",
       Title contains "Data Exfiltration", "Stage4_Exfiltration",
       "Other"
   )
   | summarize Stages = make_set(AttackStage), 
             AlertCount = count() 
             by AccountName, bin(Timestamp, 1h)
   | where array_length(Stages) >= 2
   ```

   **C. Unified Insider Threat Detection**
   ```kql
   // Cross-product insider threat correlation
   let fileAccess = CloudAppEvents
   | where Timestamp > ago(1h)
   | where ActionType == "FileDownloaded"
   | summarize DownloadCount = count() by AccountName;
   
   let emailActivity = EmailEvents  
   | where Timestamp > ago(1h)
   | where EmailDirection == "Outbound"
   | where AttachmentCount > 0
   | summarize EmailCount = count() by SenderFromAddress;
