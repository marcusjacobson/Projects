# Week 1 Completion: AI Integration Readiness Strategy

This document provides focused activities to prepare your validated Defender for Cloud deployments for AI integration in Week 2.

## üéØ Prerequisites

**‚úÖ Infrastructure Deployment Complete:**

Your infrastructure should be deployed through one of these methods:

- **Automated Scripts** (Recommended): `.\Deploy-Complete.ps1 -UseParametersFile`
- **Manual Portal Deployment**: Individual components deployed via Azure Portal
- **Partial Automation**: Mix of scripted and manual deployment

**üéØ AI Readiness Objective:**

Prepare your validated Defender for Cloud foundation specifically for Week 2 AI service integration, focusing on East US deployment with full UEBA support.

## üîß Portal-Only Deployment Setup

> **üìù Note:** This section is **only required** if you deployed your infrastructure manually through Azure Portal and haven't set up Azure CLI authentication yet. If you used our automated scripts (`Deploy-Complete.ps1`), skip to the [Quick Start](#-quick-start-automated-validation) section.

If you deployed infrastructure manually through Azure Portal, you'll need to set up Azure CLI for the validation script:

### Step 1: Install Azure CLI (if needed)

```powershell
# Check if Azure CLI is installed
az --version

# If not installed, download from: https://aka.ms/installazurecli
```

### Step 2: Authenticate to Azure

```powershell
# Login to Azure (will open browser for authentication)
az login

# Verify you're connected to the correct subscription
az account show --query "{name:name, id:id}" --output table

# If needed, set the correct subscription
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
```

### Step 3: Identify Your Resource Information

```powershell
# Find your Defender for Cloud resource group
az group list --query "[?contains(name, 'defender') || contains(name, 'aisec') || contains(name, 'security')].{Name:name, Location:location}" --output table

# List resources in your security resource group (replace with your actual name)
az resource list --resource-group "your-resource-group-name" --query "[].{Name:name, Type:type, Location:location}" --output table

# Find your Log Analytics workspace (needed for Sentinel)
az monitor log-analytics workspace list --query "[?contains(name, 'sentinel') || contains(name, 'security') || contains(name, 'defender')].{Name:name, ResourceGroup:resourceGroup, Location:location}" --output table
```

## üöÄ Quick Start: Automated Validation

For automated validation of your AI readiness, use the comprehensive PowerShell scripts:

```powershell
# Step 1: Enable Sentinel AI features for Week 2
.\scripts\Deploy-SentinelAIFeatures.ps1 -UseParametersFile -DetailedOutput

# Step 2: Run AI Integration Readiness validation
.\scripts\Test-AIIntegrationReadiness.ps1 -UseParametersFile -DetailedReport

# Expected Result: "READY for Week 2 AI Integration" with 100% completion score
```

These scripts perform all the infrastructure, security, and AI readiness checks automatically and provide structured readiness reports.

## ü§ñ AI Integration Readiness Validation

### Expected Script Output

When you run `Test-AIIntegrationReadiness.ps1`, you should see:

```powershell
üéØ AI Integration Readiness Assessment

   ‚Ä¢ Security Contacts: Configured
   ‚Ä¢ JIT VM Access: Active

‚úÖ Step 3: AI Service Availability (2/2 Complete)
   ‚Ä¢ Azure OpenAI: Available in East US
   ‚Ä¢ Network Connectivity: Confirmed

‚úÖ Step 4: Week 2 Infrastructure Planning (2/2 Complete)
   ‚Ä¢ Primary Region: East US
   ‚Ä¢ Cost Estimate: ~$50/month

‚úÖ Step 5: Week 2 AI Integration Prerequisites (2/2 Complete)
   ‚Ä¢ Defender Foundation: Validated
   ‚Ä¢ Sentinel Workspace: Available
   ‚Ä¢ AI Features: Ready for configuration

üéâ FINAL SCORE: 5/5 (100%)
üöÄ STATUS: READY for Week 2 AI Integration
üìç LOCATION: East US (Full AI Support)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

If the script shows less than 100% readiness, here are common solutions:

### Issue 1: Script Authentication Errors

**Problem:** `Test-AIIntegrationReadiness.ps1` fails with authentication errors.

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Re-authenticate to Azure
Disconnect-AzAccount
Connect-AzAccount

# Verify subscription context
Get-AzContext

# Set correct subscription if needed
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id"
```

### Issue 2: Infrastructure Not Found

**Problem:** Script reports missing resource group, Log Analytics workspace, or VMs.

**Solution:** Deploy or complete your infrastructure first:

```powershell
# Deploy complete infrastructure
.\Deploy-Complete.ps1 -UseParametersFile

# Or deploy components individually
.\Deploy-InfrastructureFoundation.ps1 -UseParametersFile
.\Deploy-VirtualMachines.ps1 -UseParametersFile
```

### Issue 3: Missing UEBA Features

**Problem:** UEBA not available in your region.

**Solution:** Validate you're deployed in East US (done automatically by our scripts):

```powershell
# Check current deployment region
az group show --name $resourceGroupName --query "location" --output tsv

# If not in East US, consider redeployment with our scripts:
# .\Remove-DefenderInfrastructure.ps1 -UseParametersFile -Force
# (Update main.parameters.json location to "eastus")
# .\Deploy-Complete.ps1 -UseParametersFile
```

### Issue 4: Sentinel Data Connector Issues

**Problem:** Sentinel shows connection errors or orphaned states.

**Solution:** Our `Deploy-Sentinel.ps1` script automatically handles this:

```powershell
# Run Sentinel deployment with automatic cleanup
.\Deploy-Sentinel.ps1 -UseParametersFile

# The script will automatically detect and clean orphaned onboarding states
# Look for: "No existing onboarding state found - proceeding with fresh enablement"
```

### Issue 5: Security Foundation Incomplete

**Problem:** Missing Defender plans or security contacts.

**Solution:** Enable security features:

```powershell
# Deploy security features
.\Deploy-SecurityFeatures.ps1 -UseParametersFile
```
