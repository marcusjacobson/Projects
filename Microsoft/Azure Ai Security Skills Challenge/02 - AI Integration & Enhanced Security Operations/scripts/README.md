## üéØ Deployment Patterns

### Phase 1: Foundation & Cost Controls

```powershell
cd "scripts\scripts-deployment"
.\Deploy-StorageFoundation.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -NotificationEmail "admin@company.com"
cd "scripts\scripts-deployment"
.\Deploy-CostManagement.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -NotificationEmail "admin@company.com" -BudgetLimit 150
```

### Phase 2: AI Services

```powershell
cd "scripts\scripts-deployment"
.\Deploy-OpenAIService.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -NotificationEmail "admin@company.com"
cd "scripts\scripts-orchestration"
.\Deploy-DefenderXDRIntegration.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec"
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

```powershell
cd "scripts\scripts-deployment"
.\Deploy-BuiltinAIFeatures.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec"
cd "scripts\scripts-validation"
.\Test-AIIntegration.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec"
```

## üìä Validation Framework

### Multi-Level Validation

1. **Resource Validation**: Verify all AI services are deployed correctly
2. **Cost Compliance**: Ensure budget adherence and optimization
3. **Security Validation**: Confirm security configurations
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate AI automation workflows
5. **Performance Testing**: Assess prompt effectiveness and token usage

### Validation Scoring

Each validation script provides detailed scoring:

- **Pass/Fail Status** for each component
- **Cost Utilization** percentage and recommendations
- **Security Posture** assessment
- **Integration Readiness** score for advanced features

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Scenarios

#### AI Service Deployment Fails

```powershell
# Check quotas and regional availability
cd "scripts\scripts-validation"
.\Test-AIIntegration.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -CheckQuotas
```

#### Budget Exceeded

```powershell
# Optimize costs and adjust capacity
cd "scripts\scripts-decommission"
.\Optimize-AICosts.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -ReduceCapacity
```

#### Integration Issues

```powershell
# Validate connections and configurations
cd "scripts\scripts-validation"
.\Test-AIIntegration.ps1 -EnvironmentName "aisec" -Verbose
```

## üîó Integration with Week 1

These scripts build upon Week 1's Defender for Cloud foundation:

- **Shared resource groups** for cost tracking
- **Integrated monitoring** across security platforms
- **Unified cost management** for complete lab oversight
- **Consistent deployment patterns** and validation frameworks

## üìö Best Practices

### Script Execution

1. **Always run WhatIf first** to preview changes
2. **Monitor costs continuously** during deployment
3. **Validate each phase** before proceeding
4. **Use consistent environment names** across scripts
5. **Keep notification emails current** for alerts

### Cost Management

1. **Deploy cost controls first** before AI services
2. **Monitor token usage** and optimize prompts
3. **Use minimum viable capacity** for AI services
4. **Regular cost reviews** and optimization
5. **Automated cleanup** of unused resources
