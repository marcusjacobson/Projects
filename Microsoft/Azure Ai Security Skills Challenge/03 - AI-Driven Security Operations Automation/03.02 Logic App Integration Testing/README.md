- **Load Testing**: Validate workflow performance under multiple concurrent incidents

## üîç Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic Workflow Validation**

**Objective**: Confirm Logic Apps workflow executes successfully with test data

**Test Steps**:

1. **Manual Trigger Test**: Execute Logic Apps workflow with sample incident data
2. **API Response Validation**: Verify AI analysis generates expected output format
3. **Data Persistence Test**: Confirm incident analysis is stored in Table Storage with proper duplicate prevention

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Logic Apps execution completes without errors
- AI analysis contains required security assessment components (threat level, recommendations, MITRE ATT&CK mapping)
- Duplicate prevention system correctly identifies and handles repeat incidents

### **Scenario 2: Authentication and Authorization Testing**

**Objective**: Validate all authentication mechanisms are functioning correctly

**Test Steps**:

1. **Graph API Authentication**: Test Microsoft Graph Security API access using App Registration
2. **OpenAI Service Authentication**: Confirm Azure OpenAI API connectivity using managed identity or API key
3. **Key Vault Integration**: Validate secure retrieval of connection secrets

**Expected Outcomes**:

- All API calls authenticate successfully without permission errors
- Secrets are retrieved securely from Key Vault
- Managed identity or service principal has appropriate role assignments

### **Scenario 3: Error Handling and Resilience Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure workflow handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate logging

**Test Steps**:

1. **Network Connectivity Failure**: Simulate temporary API unavailability
2. **Invalid Input Data**: Test workflow response to malformed incident data
3. **Rate Limiting Response**: Validate behavior when API rate limits are reached

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Workflows implement proper retry logic for transient failures
- Error messages are logged appropriately for troubleshooting
- Failed workflows can be reprocessed after resolving underlying issues
