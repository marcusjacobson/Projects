# Week 4 ‚Äì Advanced XDR + Security Copilot Integration

This week focuses on advanced integration scenarios building on the AI-driven security operations automation established in Week 3. The goal is to implement Microsoft Defender XDR integration with Sentinel and explore cost-effective Security Copilot usage patterns for enterprise-grade security operations.

## üéØ Objectives

- Deploy Microsoft Defender XDR and integrate it with Microsoft Sentinel.
- Implement Microsoft Security Copilot with cost-effective on-demand usage strategies.
- Compare Security Copilot vs Azure OpenAI effectiveness for different security scenarios.
- Simulate complex incident triage and investigation workflows using Copilot with SCU cost management.
- Create advanced prompt entries for:
  - Interactive security investigations
  - Multi-platform incident response
  - Advanced threat hunting with AI assistance
- Document comprehensive XDR + Copilot integration patterns and cost optimization strategies.

## üìÅ Deliverables

- Defender XDR deployed and fully integrated with Sentinel.
- Security Copilot tested in complex triage and investigation scenarios.
- SCU cost management and on-demand usage strategies implemented and validated.
- Advanced prompt entries created for enterprise security operations.
- Effectiveness comparison report: Security Copilot vs Azure OpenAI for different use cases.
- Comprehensive integration walkthrough and cost optimization guide published.
