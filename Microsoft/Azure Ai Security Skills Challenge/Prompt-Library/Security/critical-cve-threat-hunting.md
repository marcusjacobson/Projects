## üìù Prompt Content

```text
You are a senior threat intelligence analyst and threat hunter. Your task is to research and analyze the most critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities from the past week to enable proactive threat hunting.

**RESEARCH PHASE:**
1. Identify the 5 most critical CVEs published or updated within the last 7 days
2. Prioritize based on:
   - CVSS v3.1 base score (‚â•7.0 required)
   - Availability of public exploits or proof-of-concepts
   - Real-world exploitation reports
   - Potential impact on enterprise environments
   - Affected software prevalence in corporate networks

**ANALYSIS PHASE:**
For each identified CVE, provide:
- CVE ID and official title
- CVSS v3.1 score and vector
- Affected products/versions
- Vulnerability type and technical details
- Known exploitation status (wild exploitation, PoC available, etc.)
- MITRE ATT&CK TTPs associated with exploitation

**THREAT HUNTING PHASE:**
For each CVE, develop:
- Specific indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- KQL queries for Microsoft Sentinel/Defender
- Sigma rules for SIEM detection
- PowerShell/CLI commands for manual investigation
- Network-based detection signatures
- File system artifacts to monitor

**MITIGATION PHASE:**
For each CVE, recommend:
- Immediate containment actions
- Patch prioritization timeline
- Compensating controls if patches unavailable
- Configuration changes to reduce attack surface
- Monitoring and logging enhancements

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Structure your response as:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences per CVE)
2. Detailed CVE Analysis Table
3. Threat Hunting Playbooks (one per CVE)
4. Detection Queries and Rules
5. Mitigation Roadmap with priorities

Ensure all information is current, actionable, and suitable for immediate deployment in enterprise security operations.
```

## üîß Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Access to threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability databases
- Knowledge of CVSS scoring methodology
- Understanding of common enterprise security tools (SIEM, EDR, NDR)
- Familiarity with threat hunting methodologies and MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Access to security tools for query deployment and testing

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Step 1:** Deploy the prompt in your preferred AI platform with access to current threat intelligence
2. **Step 2:** Review the generated CVE list and validate against official sources (NIST NVD, CISA KEV)
3. **Step 3:** Customize the hunting queries for your specific security stack and environment
4. **Step 4:** Test detection rules in a safe environment before production deployment
5. **Step 5:** Implement monitoring and alerting based on the provided IoCs and signatures
6. **Step 6:** Execute the mitigation roadmap based on your organization's risk tolerance and patching capabilities

### Parameters/Variables

If the prompt includes customizable elements, list them here:

- `[TIME_PERIOD]`: Adjust from "last 7 days" to different timeframes (3 days, 14 days, etc.)
- `[CVSS_THRESHOLD]`: Modify minimum CVSS score (default 7.0) based on organizational risk appetite
- `[ENVIRONMENT_TYPE]`: Specify target environment (Windows, Linux, cloud, OT/ICS) for focused analysis
- `[SECURITY_TOOLS]`: Customize query formats for specific SIEM platforms (Splunk, QRadar, etc.)

## üí° Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Weekly SOC Briefing

**Context:** SOC manager needs to prepare weekly threat briefing for leadership
**Input:** Current date and standard corporate technology stack information
**Expected Output:** Executive summary with 5 critical CVEs, risk assessment, and recommended actions with timelines

### Example 2: Emergency Response Planning

**Context:** Security team discovers potential exploitation attempts and needs to assess current threat landscape
**Input:** Specific timeframe and affected technology stack details
**Expected Output:** Prioritized CVE list with immediate hunting queries and containment procedures

### Example 3: Proactive Defense Enhancement

**Context:** Security analyst wants to improve detection capabilities based on latest threats
**Input:** Current detection tool capabilities and environment specifications
**Expected Output:** Customized detection rules, hunting queries, and monitoring recommendations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations & Limitations

### Security Considerations

- Ensure threat intelligence sources are reputable and current
- Validate CVE information against multiple authoritative sources before taking action
- Consider information sharing restrictions when disseminating intelligence within organization
- Protect sensitive hunting techniques and IoCs from unauthorized disclosure

### Technical Limitations

- AI platforms may not have access to real-time vulnerability databases
- Generated queries may require customization for specific security tool versions
- Some CVEs may lack sufficient public information for comprehensive hunting guidance
- Detection rules effectiveness depends on log quality and security tool configuration

### Best Practices

- Cross-reference AI-generated CVE information with official advisories
- Test all detection queries in non-production environments first
- Maintain version control for hunting playbooks and detection rules
- Document false positive rates and tune queries accordingly
- Establish feedback loops to improve prompt effectiveness over time

## üìä Testing & Validation

### Test Scenarios

- [x] **Test Case 1:** Validate CVE information accuracy against NIST NVD and vendor advisories
- [x] **Test Case 2:** Test hunting queries in security tools to ensure proper syntax and logic
- [x] **Test Case 3:** Verify mitigation recommendations align with vendor guidance and industry best practices

### Validation Checklist

- [x] All CVEs identified are from the specified timeframe and meet criticality criteria
- [x] CVSS scores and vulnerability details match official sources
- [x] Hunting queries execute successfully in target security platforms
- [x] Mitigation steps are feasible and appropriately prioritized
- [x] Detection rules generate actionable alerts without excessive false positives
