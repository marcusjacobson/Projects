# AI Skilling Roadmap ‚Äì Marcus Jacobson

Welcome to the AI Skilling Roadmap repository! This project outlines a **9-week journey** to build deep, hands-on expertise in secure AI deployment, Microsoft Security tools, and Copilot integration. It aligns with Microsoft's AI Transformation strategy and EAG Security's FY26 objectives, with a strong emphasis on practical delivery, governance, and reusable prompt engineering.

## üåç **Important: Regional Deployment Guidance**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This project deploys infrastructure to **East US** region for complete AI security coverage and curriculum compliance.

**Why East US is Required:**

- **Unified Security Operations**: Required for Week 2 modern security operations platform integration with complete regional feature availability.
- **Complete AI Coverage**: Ensures all advanced security features are available for hands-on learning and enterprise deployment scenarios.
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Week 2 explicitly requires modern unified security operations integration and validation.
- **Future-Proofing**: Optimal foundation for Weeks 3-9 advanced AI security scenarios.

**Regional Impact**: Deploying in regions with limited modern security operations features would create a curriculum compliance gap and prevent completion of required Week 2 deliverables.

üìñ **Learn More**: [Microsoft Defender XDR unified security operations platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/)

## üìå Project Goals

- Build a structured, week-by-week AI skilling plan tailored to security-focused consulting.
- Integrate Microsoft Defender, Purview, Priva, Fabric, and Copilot Studio into real-world scenarios.
- Develop and publish reusable prompt libraries and deployment guides.
- Automate publishing workflows using GitHub Pages and Hugo.
- Share learnings and artifacts incrementally to support internal enablement and customer delivery.

## üéØ **9-Week Learning Path Structure**

This roadmap has been optimized for working professionals with a logical progression through **4 distinct phases**:

### **Phase 1: Security Infrastructure Foundations (Weeks 1-3)**

- **Week 1**: Master Defender for Cloud deployment mastery with modern unified security operations foundation
- **Week 2**: Implement AI integration and enhanced security operations platform
- **Week 3**: Deploy advanced XDR + Security Copilot integration

### **Phase 2: Data Governance & Analytics (Weeks 4-5)**

- **Week 4**: Microsoft Purview for comprehensive data governance
- **Week 5**: Microsoft Priva and responsible AI governance frameworks

### **Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & AI Development (Weeks 6-7)**

- **Week 6**: Microsoft Fabric for secure analytics and data pipelines
- **Week 7**: Azure AI Foundry and secure AI workload deployment

### **Phase 4: Applied AI & Enterprise Delivery (Weeks 8-9)**

- **Week 8**: Copilot Studio for security agents and AI automation
- **Week 9**: Secure Copilot deployment and comprehensive delivery practices

## ‚ö° **Key Benefits of This Structure**

- **Realistic Time Investment**: Each week designed for 8-12 hours total (manageable with full-time work)
- **Logical Learning Flow**: Each phase builds methodically on previous knowledge
- **Balanced Workload**: Complex deployment work separated from AI integration
- **Practical Outcomes**: Every week delivers deployable solutions and reusable assets
- **Enterprise Ready**: Progresses from foundational skills to customer-facing delivery capability

## üåê Project Site

All publications and guides will be integrated into the main Hugo site.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Each week is organized as a separate folder to support modular development and publishing.
