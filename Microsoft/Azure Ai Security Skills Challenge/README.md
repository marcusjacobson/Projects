# AI Skilling Roadmap – Marcus Jacobson

Welcome to the AI Skilling Roadmap repository! This project outlines a 12-week journey to build deep, hands-on expertise in secure AI deployment, Microsoft Security tools, and Copilot integration. It aligns with Microsoft’s AI Transformation strategy and EAG Security’s FY26 objectives, with a strong emphasis on practical delivery, governance, and reusable prompt engineering.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a structured, week-by-week AI skilling plan tailored to security-focused consulting.
- Integrate Microsoft Defender, Purview, Priva, Fabric, and Copilot Studio into real-world scenarios.
- Develop and publish reusable prompt libraries and deployment guides.
- Automate publishing workflows using GitHub Pages and Hugo.
- Share learnings and artifacts incrementally to support internal enablement and customer delivery.

## 🌐 Project Site

All publications and guides will be integrated into the main Hugo site.
