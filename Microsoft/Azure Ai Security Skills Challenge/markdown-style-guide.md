- Provide sufficient context and explanation for complex procedures.
- Use descriptive headings that clearly indicate content purpose.
- Structure content logically with clear progression from simple to complex topics.

---

## üéØ Punctuation Rules

### Bullet Points

- **Standalone bullet points must end with periods.**
- **Introductory bullet points that lead to sub-lists must end with colons.**
- This applies to all list items, maintaining logical punctuation based on their function.
- Use consistent bullet point formatting throughout the document.

#### Standalone Bullet Points (End with Periods)

Use periods when bullet points are complete, standalone actions or statements:

- Enable disk encryption on virtual machines.
- Install endpoint protection solution on machines.
- Apply system updates using Azure Update Manager integration.

#### Introductory Bullet Points (End with Colons)

Use colons when bullet points introduce or lead to sub-lists:

- Review and disable advanced protection for:
  - **Servers** ‚Üí Set to **Off**.
  - **App Service** ‚Üí Set to **Off**.
  - **Storage** ‚Üí Set to **Off**.
- Configure the following settings:
  - Enable monitoring.
  - Set retention period.
  - Configure alerts.

#### Incorrect Examples

- Enable disk encryption on virtual machines
- Install endpoint protection solution on machines
- Review and disable advanced protection for.
  - **Servers** ‚Üí Set to **Off**.
  - **App Service** ‚Üí Set to **Off**.

### Sentences and Paragraphs

- All sentences must end with appropriate punctuation (periods, question marks, exclamation points).
- Use periods for declarative statements and instructions.
- Use question marks for rhetorical questions or user prompts.
- Avoid excessive exclamation points; use sparingly for emphasis.

### Code and Interface Elements

- Use backticks for single words, commands, or short code snippets: `command`.
- Use code blocks for multi-line code or extended commands.
- Use periods after sentences that contain inline code elements.

---

## üî§ Formatting Standards

### Bold Text for Interface Elements

- **Bold all quoted targets instead of using quotation marks.**
- This includes button text, menu items, field names, resource names, and UI elements.
- Bold formatting provides better visual hierarchy and modern documentation standards.

#### Correct Formatting Examples

- Click **Create** to proceed with deployment.
- Navigate to **Environment settings** in the left menu.
- Set the **Virtual machine name** to **vm-windows-server**.
- Toggle the status to **On** for enhanced protection.

#### Incorrect Formatting Examples

- Click "Create" to proceed with deployment.
- Navigate to "Environment settings" in the left menu.
- Set the "Virtual machine name" to "vm-windows-server".
- Toggle the status to "On" for enhanced protection.

### Headers and Structure

- **Use hash-based headers (#, ##, ###) instead of bold text for section titles.**
- **Avoid using bold text followed by colons as section headers** - convert these to proper hash-based headers.
- **Make header text unique to avoid duplicate heading lint warnings** - use descriptive, specific titles.
- Use consistent header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to create proper document structure.
- Include appropriate emoji icons for main sections when enhancing readability.
- Use descriptive headers that clearly indicate section content.
- Maintain logical content flow from general to specific information.
- Reserve bold text for interface elements, resource names, and emphasis within content.

#### Common Bold Text Header Issues to Avoid

These patterns should be converted to proper headers:

```markdown
‚ùå Incorrect (Bold text acting as headers):
**Configuration Steps:**
**Verification Steps:** 
**Expected Results:**
**Important Notes:**
**Cost Monitoring:**
**What Gets Removed:**

‚úÖ Correct (Proper hash-based headers):
#### Configuration Steps
#### Verification Steps  
#### Expected Results
#### Important Notes
#### Cost Monitoring
#### What Gets Removed
```

#### Header Uniqueness Requirements

Avoid duplicate headers by making them specific:

```markdown
‚ùå Incorrect (Duplicate headers):
#### Configuration Steps (appears multiple times)
#### Verification Steps (appears multiple times)

‚úÖ Correct (Unique descriptive headers):
#### Workbook Configuration Steps
#### Sentinel Connector Configuration Steps
#### Defender XDR Verification Steps
#### Sentinel Verification Steps
```

#### Correct Header Examples

```markdown
# Main Document Title
## Major Section Title
### Subsection Title
#### Detailed Topic Title
```

#### Incorrect Header Examples

```markdown
**Major Section Title**
**Subsection Title**
**Detailed Topic Title**
```

#### When to Use Bold vs Headers

- **Use Headers For**: Document structure, section titles, step titles, topic organization, any text that serves as a section divider or organizer.
- **Use Bold For**: Interface elements, button names, field names, resource names, emphasis within content, subsection labels within paragraphs.

#### Bold Text vs Header Decision Matrix

| Content Type | Formatting | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Section divider | Header (####) | `#### Configuration Steps` |
| Subsection within content | Bold | `**Configuration Steps:** Follow these procedures...` |
| Interface element | Bold | `Click **Save** to proceed` |
| Resource name | Bold | `Navigate to **Resource Group**` |
| Standalone section | Header (####) | `#### Expected Results` |
| Timeline/status info | Header (####) | `#### Defender XDR Timeline` |

### Code Block Formatting

- Use appropriate language identifiers for syntax highlighting.
- **Ensure code blocks are surrounded by blank lines** to avoid MD031 lint warnings.
- Include clear explanations before and after code blocks.
- Use consistent indentation and formatting within code blocks.
- Add comments to complex code examples for clarity.

#### Correct Code Block Formatting

Use proper spacing and language identifiers:

```text
‚úÖ Correct format:
Text before code block.

```powershell
# PowerShell command example
Get-AzResourceGroup
```

Text after code block.

‚ùå Incorrect format:
Text before code block.
```powershell
# PowerShell command example  
Get-AzResourceGroup
```
Text after code block.
```

### List Formatting

- **Ensure lists are surrounded by blank lines** to avoid MD032 lint warnings.
- Use consistent list formatting throughout documents.
- Maintain proper indentation for nested lists.
- Follow punctuation rules for list items (periods for standalone, colons for introductory).

#### Correct List Formatting

```markdown
‚úÖ Correct (surrounded by blank lines):
Text before list.

- First list item.
- Second list item.
- Third list item.

Text after list.

‚ùå Incorrect (no blank lines):
Text before list.
- First list item.
- Second list item.
Text after list.
```

### Links and References

- Use descriptive link text that indicates destination content.
- Include screenshot references with clear descriptions.
- Format external links with full URLs when appropriate.
- Use consistent link formatting throughout documents.
