This style guide defines the formatting, punctuation, and tone standards for all markdown documentation within the Azure AI Security Skills Challenge project. It ensures consistency, professionalism, and clarity across all technical documentation.

## üìã General Principles

### Professional Technical Documentation Voice

- Use clear, concise, and professional language throughout all documentation.
- Write in an instructional tone suitable for technical professionals.
- Avoid casual language, contractions, and informal expressions.
- Maintain consistency in terminology and technical concepts.
- Use active voice when possible for clarity and directness.

### Accessibility and Clarity

- Provide sufficient context and explanation for complex procedures.
- Use descriptive headings that clearly indicate content purpose.
- Structure content logically with clear progression from simple to complex topics.

## üéØ Punctuation Rules

### Bullet Points

- **All bullet points must end with periods.**
- This applies to all list items, regardless of length or complexity.
- Use consistent bullet point formatting throughout the document.

#### Correct Examples

- Enable disk encryption on virtual machines.
- Install endpoint protection solution on machines.
- Apply system updates using Azure Update Manager integration.

#### Incorrect Examples

- Enable disk encryption on virtual machines
- Install endpoint protection solution on machines
- Apply system updates using Azure Update Manager integration

### Sentences and Paragraphs

- All sentences must end with appropriate punctuation (periods, question marks, exclamation points).
- Use periods for declarative statements and instructions.
- Use question marks for rhetorical questions or user prompts.
- Avoid excessive exclamation points; use sparingly for emphasis.

### Code and Interface Elements

- Use backticks for single words, commands, or short code snippets: `command`.
- Use code blocks for multi-line code or extended commands.
- Use periods after sentences that contain inline code elements.

## üî§ Formatting Standards

### Bold Text for Interface Elements

- **Bold all quoted targets instead of using quotation marks.**
- This includes button text, menu items, field names, resource names, and UI elements.
- Bold formatting provides better visual hierarchy and modern documentation standards.

#### Correct Formatting Examples

- Click **Create** to proceed with deployment.
- Navigate to **Environment settings** in the left menu.
- Set the **Virtual machine name** to **vm-windows-server**.
- Toggle the status to **On** for enhanced protection.

#### Incorrect Formatting Examples

- Click "Create" to proceed with deployment.
- Navigate to "Environment settings" in the left menu.
- Set the "Virtual machine name" to "vm-windows-server".
- Toggle the status to "On" for enhanced protection.

### Headers and Structure

- Use consistent header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
- Include appropriate emoji icons for main sections when enhancing readability.
- Use descriptive headers that clearly indicate section content.
- Maintain logical content flow from general to specific information.

### Links and References

- Use descriptive link text that indicates destination content.
- Include screenshot references with clear descriptions.
- Format external links with full URLs when appropriate.
- Use consistent link formatting throughout documents.

### Code Blocks

- Use appropriate language identifiers for syntax highlighting.
- Include clear explanations before and after code blocks.
- Use consistent indentation and formatting within code blocks.
- Add comments to complex code examples for clarity.
