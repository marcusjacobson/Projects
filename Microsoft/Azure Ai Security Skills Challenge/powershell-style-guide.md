# PowerShell Script Style Guide for Azure Deployment Automation

This style guide establishes consistent visual and organizational patterns for PowerShell scripts in Azure deployment automation projects. It defines clear hierarchical structures, color schemes, and terminology usage to enhance readability, maintainability, and user experience.

## üìã General Principles

### Professional Script Architecture

- Use clear, hierarchical organization with distinct orchestrator and individual script patterns.
- Implement consistent color schemes for visual clarity and user experience.
- Maintain standardized terminology throughout all scripts (Phase vs Step).
- Provide comprehensive status feedback and error handling.
- Follow established naming conventions and formatting standards.

### Visual Consistency and User Experience

- Use consistent color coding for similar message types across all scripts.
- Provide clear visual hierarchy with appropriate headers and indentation.
- Include progress indicators and status notifications for user feedback.
- Implement professional emoji usage for enhanced readability.

## üìù Script Preamble Standards

### Industry-Standard Documentation Requirements

All PowerShell scripts must include a comprehensive preamble at the top of the file that provides complete documentation for users, administrators, and future maintainers. This preamble follows industry-standard practices and ensures professional documentation quality.

### Required Preamble Structure

PowerShell scripts must use the industry-standard comment-based help format with dot-prefixed headers. This format provides native PowerShell help integration and follows Microsoft's official documentation standards.

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Brief one-line description of what the script does.

.DESCRIPTION
    Comprehensive multi-paragraph description explaining the script's purpose,
    functionality, and expected outcomes. Include details about what the script
    accomplishes, how it integrates with other components, and any important
    operational considerations.

.PARAMETER ParameterName
    Description of each parameter including its purpose, expected values,
    and any special considerations for usage.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ScriptName.ps1 -UseParametersFile
    
    Basic usage with parameters file loading configuration from main.parameters.json.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ScriptName.ps1 -EnvironmentName "prodlab" -Location "East US"
    
    Custom usage with specific parameters for targeted deployment scenarios.

### Specialized Preamble Sections

Based on script functionality, include appropriate specialized sections that provide context-specific information relevant to users and maintainers.

#### When to Include Specialized Sections

Add specialized sections when your script has unique characteristics that benefit from additional documentation:

- **Complex workflows**: Scripts that orchestrate multiple operations or phases
- **Domain-specific functionality**: Scripts focused on compliance, cost analysis, testing, etc.
- **Integration requirements**: Scripts that interact with specific Azure services or external systems
- **Configuration dependencies**: Scripts with particular setup or prerequisite requirements

#### Common Specialized Section Types

Choose the most appropriate section type(s) for your script:

**PHASES** - For orchestrator scripts that coordinate multiple operations:

```powershell
# PHASES
#     Phase 1: [Brief description] ([script-name.ps1])
#     Phase 2: [Brief description] ([script-name.ps1])
#     Phase N: [Brief description] ([script-name.ps1])
```

**COMPLIANCE STANDARDS** - For scripts managing regulatory or security compliance:

```powershell
# COMPLIANCE STANDARDS
#     - [Primary compliance framework]
#     - [Secondary compliance framework]
#     - [Additional standards as applicable]
```

**COST CATEGORIES** - For scripts analyzing or managing Azure costs:

```powershell
# COST CATEGORIES
#     - [Primary cost category] ([brief explanation])
#     - [Secondary cost category] ([brief explanation])
#     - [Additional cost factors as relevant]
```

**TEST SCENARIOS** - For validation or testing scripts:

```powershell
# TEST SCENARIOS
#     - [Test category 1] ([brief scope])
#     - [Test category 2] ([brief scope])
#     - [Additional test types as applicable]
```

**INTEGRATION POINTS** - For scripts that connect with external services:

```powershell
# INTEGRATION POINTS
#     - [Service/system 1] ([connection type])
#     - [Service/system 2] ([connection type])
#     - [Additional integrations as applicable]
```

**CONFIGURATION ITEMS** - For scripts that manage complex configurations:

```powershell
# CONFIGURATION ITEMS
#     - [Configuration area 1] ([scope or impact])
#     - [Configuration area 2] ([scope or impact])
#     - [Additional configuration aspects]
```

#### Guidelines for Creating Custom Specialized Sections

When none of the common types fit your script's unique requirements:

1. **Use descriptive section names** that clearly indicate the content purpose
2. **Follow the established format** with section header and bulleted list
3. **Keep entries concise** but informative enough to provide value
4. **Focus on information** that helps users understand scope, dependencies, or outcomes
5. **Consider the audience** - what would be most helpful for someone using or maintaining this script?

**Example of a custom specialized section:**

```powershell
# BACKUP OPERATIONS
#     - VM snapshot creation (point-in-time recovery)
#     - Configuration backup (settings and policies)
#     - Recovery testing (validation of backup integrity)
```

### Authorship and Attribution Standards

All scripts must include consistent authorship information:

```powershell
# AUTHOR
#     Marcus Jacobson
#     Script development orchestrated using GitHub Copilot
```

This attribution format:

- Identifies the primary author and maintainer
- Acknowledges the use of AI assistance in development
- Maintains transparency about development methodology
- Provides contact context for future maintenance

### Version Control Integration

The preamble supports version tracking:

```powershell
# VERSION
#     1.0.0
#
# CREATED
#     2025-08-04
#
# LAST MODIFIED
#     2025-08-04
```

Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and maintain accurate timestamps for change tracking.

## üéØ Script Classification and Structure

### Orchestrator Scripts (Use "Phase" Terminology)

**Purpose**: Scripts that call other scripts, manage complex workflows, or coordinate multiple deployment components.

**Examples**:

- `Deploy-Complete.ps1` - Master deployment orchestrator.
- `Test-FinalLabValidation.ps1` - Comprehensive validation workflow.
- `Remove-DefenderInfrastructure.ps1` - Multi-step decommission process.

**Structure**:

```powershell
# =============================================================================
# Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
# =============================================================================

Write-Host "üìã Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "====================================" -ForegroundColor Magenta
```

### Individual Component Scripts (Use "Step" Terminology)

**Purpose**: Scripts that perform specific deployment tasks, individual component configurations, or focused operations.

**Examples**:

- `Deploy-InfrastructureFoundation.ps1` - Single-purpose infrastructure deployment.
- `Deploy-VirtualMachines.ps1` - VM-specific deployment.
- `Deploy-DefenderPlans.ps1` - Security plan configuration.
- `Deploy-SecurityFeatures.ps1` - Security feature setup.
- `Test-DeploymentValidation.ps1` - Validation operations.

**Structure**:

```powershell
# =============================================================================
# Step 1: Environment Validation
# =============================================================================

Write-Host "üîç Step 1: Environment Validation" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "==================================" -ForegroundColor Green
```

---

## üé® Color Scheme Standards

### Primary Colors

- **Magenta** (`-ForegroundColor Magenta`): Main phase headers in orchestrator scripts.
- **Green** (`-ForegroundColor Green`): Step headers in individual scripts, success messages.
- **Blue** (`-ForegroundColor Blue`): Script orchestration notifications (calling scripts, completion status).
- **Red** (`-ForegroundColor Red`): Error messages, failure notifications.
- **Cyan** (`-ForegroundColor Cyan`): Informational messages, section descriptions.
- **Yellow** (`-ForegroundColor Yellow`): Warnings, confirmations, important notices.

### Status Indicators

```powershell
# Success notifications
Write-Host "‚úÖ Script 'Deploy-InfrastructureFoundation.ps1' completed successfully" -ForegroundColor Blue

# Failure notifications  
Write-Host "‚ùå Script 'Deploy-InfrastructureFoundation.ps1' failed (exit code: $LASTEXITCODE)" -ForegroundColor Red

# Script initiation
Write-Host "üöÄ Calling script 'Deploy-InfrastructureFoundation.ps1'..." -ForegroundColor Blue
```

## üìä Hierarchical Organization

### Orchestrator Scripts Structure

1. **Parameter validation and setup**.
2. **Phase 1**: Primary foundation (infrastructure, authentication).
3. **Phase 2**: Core components (VMs, networks, storage).
4. **Phase 3**: Security configuration (Defender plans, policies).
5. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (JIT access, monitoring).
6. **Phase 5**: Validation and reporting.

### Individual Scripts Structure

1. **Step 1**: Environment validation and prerequisites.
2. **Step 2**: Template preparation and validation.
3. **Step 3**: Main deployment/configuration.
4. **Step 4**: Post-deployment validation.
5. **Step 5**: Integration and next steps.

## üî§ Header Formatting Standards

### Phase Headers (Orchestrators)

```powershell
# =============================================================================
# Phase N: Descriptive Name
# =============================================================================

Write-Host "üî∏ Phase N: Descriptive Name" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "============================" -ForegroundColor Magenta
```

### Step Headers (Individual Scripts)

```powershell
# =============================================================================
# Step N: Descriptive Name
# =============================================================================

Write-Host "üî∏ Step N: Descriptive Name" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "============================" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### Subsection Headers

```powershell
Write-Host "üìã Subsection description..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
```

---

## üîî Script Notification Patterns

### Enhanced Success/Failure Notifications

```powershell
# In orchestrator scripts when calling other scripts:
Write-Host "üöÄ Calling script 'ScriptName.ps1'..." -ForegroundColor Blue
& $scriptPath @params

if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0 -or $null -eq $LASTEXITCODE) {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Script 'ScriptName.ps1' completed successfully" -ForegroundColor Blue
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Phase N completed successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Script 'ScriptName.ps1' failed (exit code: $LASTEXITCODE)" -ForegroundColor Red
    throw "Script exited with code: $LASTEXITCODE"
}
```
