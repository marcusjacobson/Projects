# Week 9 – Secure Copilot Deployment & Delivery Practices

This final week consolidates customer-facing AI solutioning, delivery practices, and secure Copilot deployment into a comprehensive capstone project. The goal is to create a complete delivery toolkit that supports enterprise Copilot deployments with proper security, governance, and delivery frameworks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a secure Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment architecture with comprehensive controls.
- Explore Microsoft's AI-first delivery frameworks and internal tools for secure AI project execution.
- Create a customer-facing AI solutioning framework for discovery, scoping, and value articulation.
- Consolidate all learning into reusable prompt libraries and deployment guides.
- Develop executive communication templates and risk mitigation strategies.
- Publish a complete delivery toolkit with architecture, governance, and implementation guidance.

## 📁 Deliverables

- Secure Microsoft 365 Copilot deployment architecture documented with identity, compliance, and data protection controls.
- AI-first delivery framework with tools, processes, and stakeholder communication templates.
- Customer-facing AI solutioning methodology with discovery and scoping frameworks.
- Comprehensive prompt library consolidating all previous weeks' entries.
- Executive summary templates and risk analysis frameworks.
- Complete delivery toolkit published with architecture diagrams, implementation guides, and governance controls.
