# Fabric + Purview Governance Simulation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This hands-on simulation teaches **DLP and Information Protection for Microsoft Fabric data**. Through **ten progressive labs**, you'll build a Fabric data estate with sensitive data (SSN, Credit Card numbers), configure DLP policies to detect that data, discover assets in the Purview Unified Catalog, and create a governed Power BI report chain.

**Target Audience**: Data engineers, governance professionals, compliance officers, and anyone learning to protect sensitive data in Microsoft Fabric.

**Approach**: UI-based step-by-step instructions validated against current Microsoft portals. All labs can be completed using the Fabric portal and Purview portal—PowerShell is used only for data generation and cleanup.

**What You'll Accomplish**:

- **Build a Fabric Data Foundation**: Lakehouse with customer PII data (SSN) and transaction data (Credit Card numbers).
- **Configure DLP Policies**: Detect sensitive data patterns when users access Fabric reports.
- **Discover Assets**: Run Data Map scans to make Fabric assets searchable in Unified Catalog.
- **Create Governed Reports**: Power BI reports that connect to DLP-protected data sources.
- **Validate Governance**: Confirm DLP detection, asset discovery, and report governance chain.

> **💰 Cost Note**: This simulation works with **Fabric Trial (free for 60 days)** or **F2 capacity (~$0.36/hr with pause capability)**. DLP scanning incurs pay-per-scan costs with M365 E5 licensing. For enterprise capabilities beyond this project, see [ENTERPRISE-GOVERNANCE-CAPABILITIES.md](./ENTERPRISE-GOVERNANCE-CAPABILITIES.md).

## ⏱️ Time and Resource Considerations

| Consideration | Impact | Planning |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| **⏱️ Total Duration** | ~5-6 hours (hands-on) | Plan for full day or 2 sessions |
| **⏱️ DLP Propagation** | Up to 24 hours | Create DLP policy in Lab 06, validate in Lab 09 next day |
| **⏱️ Data Map Scan** | 5-15 minutes | Assets appear in Unified Catalog after scan |
| **💰 Fabric Cost** | $0 or ~$3-5 total | 60-day trial (free) OR F2 capacity with pause |
| **💰 DLP Cost** | Pay-per-scan | Included with M365 E5 licensing |
| **🔐 Licensing** | M365 E5 + Fabric | Required for DLP policy creation |

> **⚠️ DLP Timing Note**: DLP policies for Fabric use **real-time scanning**—they detect sensitive data when users access reports, not by proactively scanning data at rest. While policy sync completes in minutes, **full detection capability can take up to 24 hours** to propagate across your tenant. For best results, complete Labs 00-06 in one session, then return the next day for Labs 07-09.

> **💡 Recommended Approach**:
>
> - **Session 1 (4 hours)**: Labs 00-06 — Prerequisites, Fabric setup, data foundation, DLP policy creation
> - **Session 2 (1.5 hours, next day)**: Labs 07-09 — Data Map scan, Power BI report, validation
> - **Cleanup**: Lab 10 — When ready to remove resources
