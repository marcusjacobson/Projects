# Microsoft Purview Skills Ramp - On-Premises & Cloud Scanning

## 🎯 Project Overview

This hands-on lab series provides comprehensive practical experience with Microsoft Purview capabilities, organized by deployment scenario: **Setup**, **On-Premises Scanning**, **Cloud Scanning**, and **Advanced Supplemental Labs**. The labs follow Microsoft's DLP lifecycle methodology and are validated against current Microsoft Learn documentation (October 2025).

**This reorganized structure separates on-premises file share scanning from SharePoint/OneDrive cloud scanning**, making it easier to focus on specific deployment scenarios while maintaining complete technical coverage.

**What Makes This Different:**

- **Scenario-Based Organization**: Clear separation between on-prem and cloud scanning workflows.
- **100% Microsoft-Aligned**: Follows official DLP lifecycle (Plan → Prepare → Design → Simulate → Monitor → Deploy).
- **Progressive Skill Building**: Setup → On-Prem → Cloud → Validation → Advanced.
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Real-world remediation automation for enterprise deployments.
- **Consultancy Project Alignment**: Addresses hybrid data governance with flexible learning paths.

## ⚠️ Critical Time & Cost Considerations

**Before starting this project, understand these key constraints:**

| Consideration | Impact | Action Required |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| **💰 Azure VM Costs** | **$3-5/day** continuous billing | Delete Resource Group immediately after labs |
| **⏱️ DLP Policy Sync** | **1-2 hours** before enforcement works | Create policies, wait, then run scans |
| **⏱️ Retention Simulation** | **1-2 days** for results (email notification) | Plan multi-day timeline for Cloud labs |
| **⏱️ Retention Activation** | **Up to 7 days** for production label application | Required for full Cloud lab completion |
| **⏱️ Activity Explorer** | **15-30 min** (basic) → **24 hrs** (trending) | Wait 24 hours for complete dashboard data |
| **⏱️ Audit Log Aggregation** | **Up to 24-48 hours** for complete visibility | Scanner activity may take time to appear |
| **🧹 Cleanup Re-Commission** | **4-6 hours** to rebuild full environment | Plan carefully before deleting Azure resources |

> **⏱️ Recommended Timeline**: **1-2 weeks total**
>
> - **Week 1**: Complete Sections 1-2 (Setup + On-Prem Scanning: ~5.5-8.5 hours hands-on)
> - **Between Weeks**: DLP policy sync (1-2 hrs), Retention simulation (1-2 days), Label activation (up to 7 days)
> - **Week 2**: Complete Section 3 (Cloud with fully activated policies: ~3-4 hours)
> - **Optional Weeks 2-4**: Supplemental Labs for production automation (11-14 hours)
>
> **💡 Accelerated Learning Option**: You can complete the hands-on configuration in **2-3 focused days** (~8.5-12.5 hours total), but retention labels will be in simulation mode only and Activity Explorer data may be incomplete.

**Cost Control Critical Path**:

1. Section 1 **starts billing** (~$3-5/day for VM + SQL)
2. Complete Sections 1-3 over 1-2 weeks (~$21-70 total cost depending on timeline)
3. **Deallocate VM between sessions** to save ~60% of compute costs
4. **Delete Azure Resource Group immediately after final validation**

> **💰 Cost Optimization**: If completing over 2 weeks, **deallocate (stop) the VM** when not actively working. This reduces daily cost from $3-5/day to ~$0.50-1.00/day (storage only). VM restarts in 2-3 minutes vs 4-6 hours to rebuild from scratch.
