================================================================================

Report Generated: 2025-12-26 18:00:52
Data Sources: Activity Explorer (On-Premises Scanner + SharePoint DLP)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Total Events Analyzed: 38
- On-Premises Scanner: 18 events (18 unique files)
- SharePoint DLP: 20 events (20 unique files)


ON-PREMISES SCANNER ANALYSIS (File Share Detection)
----------------------------------------------------

Detection Breakdown by Share:
  HR: 6 events (5 unique files)
  Finance: 5 events (5 unique files)
  Projects: 4 events (5 unique files)
  Legal: 3 events (5 unique files)

SHAREPOINT DLP ANALYSIS (Sensitive Information Type Detection)
---------------------------------------------------------------

SIT Detection Breakdown by Type:
  SharePoint Sensitive Data - Low Severity - SSN: 11 events (11 unique files)
  SharePoint Sensitive Data - High Severity - Credit Card: 9 events (11 unique files)

CROSS-PLATFORM COMPARISON
--------------------------

Platform Characteristics:
  
  On-Premises Scanner:
  - Detection Method: Batch scheduled scans
  - Activity Type: "File discovered"
  - Coverage: File shares, network storage
  - Timing: Scanner schedule-based (typically daily/weekly)
  
  SharePoint DLP:
  - Detection Method: Real-time policy evaluation
  - Activity Type: "DLP rule matched"  
  - Coverage: SharePoint Online documents
  - Timing: Real-time during user access

Detection Patterns:
  - On-Premises shows distribution across 4 file shares
  - SharePoint shows 2 distinct SIT types detected
  - Combined coverage provides hybrid environment visibility

KEY INSIGHTS
------------

1. On-Premises Coverage:
   Highest activity in "HR" share (6 events)
   
2. SharePoint SIT Detection:
   Primary detection type: "SharePoint Sensitive Data - Low Severity - SSN" (11 events)

3. Detection Methodology:
   - Scanner provides batch discovery for existing files
   - DLP provides real-time enforcement for cloud documents
   - Both methods complement each other for comprehensive governance


RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

Immediate Actions:
✓ Review on-premises files in high-activity shares for remediation
✓ Validate SharePoint DLP policies are appropriately scoped
✓ Ensure scanner schedules remain active and consistent

Strategic Guidance:
→ Expand DLP coverage to additional M365 workloads (OneDrive, Teams)
→ Optimize scanner schedules based on file change patterns
→ Establish baseline metrics for ongoing monitoring
→ Cross-reference detections with compliance requirements
